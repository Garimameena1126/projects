# Analyzing Model Predictions and Comparing to Actual Sleep Quality Labels

In this task, we will analyze the predictions made by our trained sleep quality classification model and compare them to the actual sleep quality labels. This step is crucial to evaluate the performance of our model and assess how well it is able to classify sleep quality based on the input features.

## Step 1: Load the Trained Model

Before we can analyze the predictions, we need to load the trained model that we obtained from the previous module. Assuming you have saved your trained model as a file (e.g., `model.pkl`), we can load it using the following code:

```python
import pickle

# Load the trained model
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)
```

Make sure to replace `'model.pkl'` with the actual file path and name of your trained model file.

## Step 2: Prepare Test Data

To compare the model's predictions to the actual sleep quality labels, we need a separate dataset containing examples with known labels. This dataset should be distinct from the data used for training the model. We will refer to this dataset as the "test set."

If you have not already prepared a test set, you can split your original dataset into training and test sets using techniques like train-test split or cross-validation. Alternatively, you can obtain a separate dataset specifically for testing purposes.

Once you have the test set ready, we need to preprocess it in the same way as the training data. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature scaling. Ensure that the preprocessing steps applied to the test set are consistent with those applied to the training set.

## Step 3: Make Predictions

With the trained model and the preprocessed test data in place, we can now make predictions on the test set. The model will output predicted sleep quality labels for each example in the test set.

Assuming your test data is stored in a variable named `X_test`, we can use the following code to obtain the model's predictions:

```python
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

Here, `y_pred` will contain the predicted sleep quality labels for each example in the test set.

## Step 4: Evaluate Model Performance

To assess how well our model performs in classifying sleep quality, we need to compare the predicted labels (`y_pred`) to the actual sleep quality labels (`y_true`) from the test set.

Assuming you have the actual sleep quality labels stored in a variable named `y_true`, we can calculate various performance metrics using scikit-learn's classification metrics module. Let's calculate the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score:

```python
from sklearn import metrics

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score
precision = metrics.precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
recall = metrics.recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
f1_score = metrics.f1_score(y_true, y_pred)

print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1-Score:", f1_score)
```

The `accuracy_score` function computes the accuracy of the predictions, while `precision_score`, `recall_score`, and `f1_score` calculate precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively.

## Step 5: Analyze Predictions

After evaluating the model's performance using the metrics mentioned above, it is important to further analyze the predictions to gain deeper insights into its behavior.

### Confusion Matrix

One common visualization for classification tasks is the confusion matrix, which provides a comprehensive view of the model

's performance across different classes. Let's create a confusion matrix using scikit-learn and visualize it:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create confusion matrix
confusion_matrix = metrics.confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)

# Plot confusion matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues")
plt.xlabel("Predicted Labels")
plt.ylabel("True Labels")
plt.title("Confusion Matrix")
plt.show()
```

The confusion matrix helps us understand the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives produced by the model.

### Classification Report

Another useful analysis is the classification report, which provides metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class individually. Let's generate a classification report using scikit-learn:

```python
classification_report = metrics.classification_report(y_true, y_pred)
print(classification_report)
```

The classification report gives a detailed summary of the model's performance for each sleep quality class.

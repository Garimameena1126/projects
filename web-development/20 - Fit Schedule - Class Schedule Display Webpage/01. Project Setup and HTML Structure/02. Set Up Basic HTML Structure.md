#### Task: Set up the basic structure of the HTML file

1. Open the previously created "index.html" file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
2. Inside the `<body>` element of the HTML file, add the necessary HTML tags to create the basic structure of the webpage. Modify the existing code as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Class Schedule</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <div class="logo">
            <!-- Add your company logo here -->
            <img src="path/to/logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
        </div>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Classes</a></li>
                <!-- Add more navigation links as needed -->
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <!-- This is where the class schedule display section will be added -->
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Explanation:
- We added a `<header>` element to contain the company logo and navigation bar.
- Inside the `<header>` element, there is a `<div>` with the class "logo" to hold the company logo. Replace the `src` attribute value with the path to your company logo image file.
- The navigation bar is created using an unordered list (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`). Each list item represents a navigation link. Modify the links as needed, replacing "#" with the appropriate URLs.
- Finally, we added a `<div>` element with the class "container" that will serve as the container for the class schedule display section. We will populate this section later in the project.

3. Save the file.


## Set Up a Backend Server Using Node.js with Express

1. Install Node.js:
   - Download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Open your preferred code editor.

3. Create a new project directory for your backend server.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

5. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:
   ```shell
   npm init -y
   ```

6. Install Express as a dependency by running the following command:
   ```shell
   npm install express
   ```

7. Create a new file called `server.js` in the project directory.

8. Open the `server.js` file in your code editor.

9. Import the Express module and create an instance of the Express application:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   ```

10. Define a basic route to handle incoming requests and send a response:
    ```javascript
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello, world!');
    });
    ```

11. Start the server and listen for incoming requests on a specified port:
    ```javascript
    const port = 3000;
    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
    });
    ```

12. Save the `server.js` file.

13. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

14. Start the backend server by running the following command:
    ```shell
    node server.js
    ```

15. Your backend server is now running and listening for requests. You can access it by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You should see the message "Hello, world!" displayed.

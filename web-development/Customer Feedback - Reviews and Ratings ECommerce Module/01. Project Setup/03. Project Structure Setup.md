# Setting Up the Basic Project Structure

In this guide, we will help you set up the basic project structure for your web development project. The project structure includes creating the necessary folders and files that will organize your code and assets. By following these steps, you will establish a structured foundation for your project.

## Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Before setting up the project structure, make sure you are inside your project directory. Use the command line interface (CLI) and navigate to the location where you created your project directory. For example, if your project directory is named "ecommerce-reviews," you can use the following command:

```bash
cd ecommerce-reviews
```

## Step 2: Create the Basic Folders

To begin organizing your project, you will create the essential folders that will hold specific types of files. Execute the following commands in your CLI to create these folders:

```bash
mkdir public
mkdir src
```

5. **Create Backend Subfolders**

- The `public` folder: This folder will contain publicly accessible files such as HTML, CSS, images, and client-side JavaScript files.
- The `src` folder: This folder will hold the server-side code and other backend-related files.

## Step 3: Create the Files Inside the Folders

Now that you have created the necessary folders, it's time to create some initial files inside them. Execute the following commands to create the files:

Inside the `public` folder, create an `index.html` file that will serve as the main entry point of your web application:

```bash
touch public/index.html
```

Inside the `src` folder, create a `server.js` file that will contain the server-side code:

```bash
touch src/server.js
```

Great! You have created the basic project structure with the required folders and files.

## Step 4: Verify the Project Structure

To ensure that the project structure is set up correctly, you can use the `ls` command to list the contents of your project directory. Run the following command in your CLI:

```bash
ls -R
```

This command will display the directory structure recursively, showing all the folders and files in your project. It should resemble the following structure:

```
.:
public
src

./public:
index.html

./src:
server.js
```

## Next Steps

With the basic project structure in place, you can move on to the next steps, such as initializing a version control system (Git) and making an initial commit.

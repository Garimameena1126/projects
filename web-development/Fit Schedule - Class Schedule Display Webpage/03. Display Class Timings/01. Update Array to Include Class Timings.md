1. Open the JavaScript file named "script.js" that you created earlier and linked to the HTML file.

2. Locate the array variable where the class names are stored. It might look something like this:
    
    ```javascript
    // Existing array of class names
    var classNames = ["Yoga", "Pilates", "Zumba"];
    ```

3. To associate timings with each class, we'll use an array of objects. Modify the existing array to include objects that contain both the class name and timing information. Here's an example:

    ```javascript
    // Modified array with class names and timings
    var classes = [
      { name: "Yoga", timing: "8:00 AM" },
      { name: "Pilates", timing: "10:00 AM" },
      { name: "Zumba", timing: "12:00 PM" }
    ];
    ```

Explanation:
- The array variable `classes` now holds objects, each representing a class with its associated properties.
- Each object has two properties: `name` for the class name and `timing` for the class timing.

4. Now that you have modified the array, you need to adjust the JavaScript code to create and display HTML elements for both class names and timings.

5. Locate the code where you dynamically generate HTML elements for class names. It might look something like this:

    ```javascript
    // Existing code to generate HTML elements for class names
    for (var i = 0; i < classNames.length; i++) {
      var className = classNames[i];
      var classElement = document.createElement("h2");
      classElement.textContent = className;
      containerElement.appendChild(classElement);
    }
    ```

6. Modify the code to incorporate the associated timings for each class. Update the loop to iterate over the `classes` array and retrieve both the class name and timing from each object. Here's the modified code:

    ```javascript
    // Updated code to generate HTML elements for class names and timings
    for (var i = 0; i < classes.length; i++) {
      var classObject = classes[i];
      var className = classObject.name;
      var classTiming = classObject.timing;
    
      var classElement = document.createElement("h2");
      classElement.textContent = className;
      containerElement.appendChild(classElement);
    
      var timingElement = document.createElement("p");
      timingElement.textContent = "Timing: " + classTiming;
      containerElement.appendChild(timingElement);
    }
    ```

Explanation:
- The updated loop now iterates over the `classes` array, which contains objects with class name and timing information.
- Inside the loop, we retrieve the class name and timing from each object using `classObject.name` and `classObject.timing`, respectively.
- For each class, we create an `<h2>` element to display the class name and append it to the container element.
- Additionally, we create a `<p>` element to display the timing information and append it to the container element.

7. Save the JavaScript file.

8. To improve the visual appearance of the class name and timing elements, let's apply some CSS styles.

9. Open the CSS file associated with your HTML file (e.g., "styles.css") or create a new CSS file if you haven't done so.

10. Add CSS rules to style the class name and timing elements. Here's an example:

    ```css
    /* CSS rules for class name and timing elements */
    h2 {
      font-size: 24px;
     
    
     font-weight: bold;
      margin-bottom: 8px;
    }
    
    p {
      font-size: 16px;
      color: #777;
    }
    ```

Explanation:
- The CSS rules target the `<h2>` and `<p>` elements to style the class name and timing, respectively.
- Adjust the styles according to your preference, such as font size, font weight, color, and margin.

11. Save the CSS file.

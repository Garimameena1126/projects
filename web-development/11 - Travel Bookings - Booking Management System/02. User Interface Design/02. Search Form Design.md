
## Design a Search Form to Allow Users to Find Travel Packages

1. Open your preferred code editor.

2. Locate the HTML file where you want to design the search form. If you don't have an existing HTML file, create a new one and name it `index.html`.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your code editor.

4. Start by adding the basic structure of an HTML document. Include the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>` element, and `<head>` and `<body>` sections. Your code should look like this:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>Tech Enabled Travel Agency</title>
       <!-- Add any CSS files or stylesheets here -->
     </head>
     <body>
       <!-- Your content will go here -->
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

5. Within the `<body>` section, create a `<form>` element to contain the search form. Set the `action` attribute to specify the URL or script that will handle the form submission. Add the `method` attribute and set it to "GET" or "POST" depending on your project requirements. For example:

   ```html
   <form action="/search" method="GET">
     <!-- Add form elements here -->
   </form>
   ```

   Customize the `action` attribute value according to your project's backend implementation.

6. Inside the `<form>` element, add form elements such as input fields, dropdown menus, and buttons to facilitate the search functionality. Here's an example of a basic search form with an input field and a submit button:

   ```html
   <form action="/search" method="GET">
     <label for="destination">Destination:</label>
     <input type="text" id="destination" name="destination" placeholder="Enter a destination">

     <button type="submit">Search</button>
   </form>
   ```

   Customize the form elements based on the specific search criteria you want to provide for your travel packages.

7. Save the `index.html` file.

8. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to preview the search form. Verify that the form elements are displayed correctly and the submit button functions as expected.

9. Apply appropriate CSS styling to enhance the appearance of the search form. You can create a separate CSS file and link it in the `<head>` section of your HTML file. Use CSS selectors and properties to modify the visual aspects of the form elements, such as colors, fonts, borders, and spacing. Here's an example:

   ```html
   <head>
     <title>Tech Enabled Travel Agency</title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   ```

   In the `styles.css` file:

   ```css
   /* Example CSS styles for the search form */
   form {
     display: flex;
     flex-direction: column;
     max-width: 400px;
     margin: 0 auto;
   }

   label {
     font-weight: bold;
   }

   input[type="text"] {
     padding: 5px;
     margin-bottom: 10px;
   }

   button[type="submit"] {
     padding: 10px;
     background-color: #337ab7;
     color: #fff;
     border: none;
     cursor: pointer;
   }
   ```

   Customize the CSS styles according to your design preferences.

10. Save the `styles.css` file.

11. Refresh the web browser to view the styled search form.

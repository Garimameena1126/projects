In this guide, we will explore how to implement version control or revision history for file attachments within your application.

### Step 1: Design the Database Schema

1. Determine the structure of your database schema to accommodate version control or revision history for file attachments.
2. Add necessary tables or fields to track file versions, such as a `versions` table or additional fields in the existing file attachment table.

### Step 2: Update File Upload Logic

1. Modify the file upload logic to save the uploaded file as a new version instead of overwriting the existing file.
2. Ensure that the unique identifier or key for the file remains the same across versions.
3. Store the additional version information, such as version number, timestamp, or user who made the change, in the database.

### Step 3: Retrieve File Versions

1. Create a route or endpoint to retrieve file versions based on the unique identifier or key.
2. Fetch the file versions from the database based on the identifier and display them in the user interface.

### Step 4: Display Version History

1. In the user interface, provide a way for users to view the version history of a file attachment.
2. Generate the appropriate URLs to the file version routes or endpoints based on the file's unique identifier or key and version number.

### Step 5: Revert to Previous Versions

1. Add functionality to revert to a previous version of a file attachment.
2. Retrieve the desired file version from the database and make it the active version.

### Step 6: Handle File Deletion and Cleanup

1. Determine how file deletion should be handled in the context of version control.
2. Decide whether to allow deletion of specific versions or only the entire file attachment.
3. Implement the necessary logic to delete files and their corresponding versions from the storage location and database.

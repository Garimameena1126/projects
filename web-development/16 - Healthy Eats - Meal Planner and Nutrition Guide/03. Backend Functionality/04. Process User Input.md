### 1. Set Up Express.js
Make sure you have Express.js installed in your project. If you haven't done so already, you can install it by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install express
```

### 2. Create a New Express Application
Create a new file, such as `app.js`, and require the Express module. Then, create a new Express application by calling the `express()` function:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

### 3. Set Up Middleware for Parsing Request Body
To process user input from the frontend, we need to set up middleware for parsing the request body. Express provides the `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON-formatted request bodies. Add the following line of code before defining your routes:

```javascript
app.use(express.json());
```

### 4. Create Routes for User Input
In Express, you can create routes to handle user input from the frontend. Let's create a route that expects user input in JSON format.

#### Example: Route for Handling POST Requests with User Input
To create a route for handling POST requests with user input, use the `app.post()` method. Specify the URL path and a callback function that will be executed when a POST request is made to that path.

In this example, we assume the frontend sends a JSON object with a `name` property. We'll retrieve the value of `name` from the request body and send an appropriate response:

```javascript
app.post('/process', (req, res) => {
  const name = req.body.name;

  // Process the user input and generate a response
  const response = `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to our application.`;

  // Send the response back to the frontend
  res.json({ message: response });
});
```

### 5. Start the Server
To start the Express server and listen for incoming requests, add the following code at the end of your file:

```javascript
const port = 3000; // Choose the port number you want to use

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### 6. Test the Route
Save the changes to your file and run it using the following command:

```bash
node app.js
```

Now, you can test the route using a tool like Postman or by making a POST request from your frontend application. Make sure to include the user input in the request body as JSON.

For example, if the user input is `{ "name": "John" }`, you can send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/process` with the JSON body.

The server will process the user input, generate an appropriate response (e.g., "Hello, John! Welcome to our application."), and send it back to the frontend as JSON.

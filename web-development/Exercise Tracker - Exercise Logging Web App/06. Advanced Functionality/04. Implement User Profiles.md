# Beginner's Guide: Implementing an Edit Button for User Reviews

In this guide, we will learn how to implement an edit button for each user's own reviews in our project. Users will be able to edit the content and rating of their reviews. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Display the Edit Button
To start with, we need to display the edit button next to each user's review. This button will allow the user to edit their review when clicked. Here's how to implement it:

1. In your review display template (e.g., `review.ejs`), add the following code inside the loop that iterates over the reviews:
```html
<!-- Assuming `review` is the current review object in the loop -->
<% if (review.userId === currentUser.id) { %>
  <a href="/reviews/<%= review.id %>/edit" class="edit-button">Edit</a>
<% } %>
```

In this example, we check if the `userId` of the current review matches the `id` of the currently logged-in user (`currentUser`). If they match, we display the edit button. The link's `href` attribute points to the edit route for the specific review (`/reviews/<%= review.id %>/edit`).

## Step 2: Create the Edit Route
Next, we need to create a route to handle the editing of a review. When the user clicks the edit button, they should be taken to a form where they can update the review content and rating. Here's how to implement it:

1. In your server file, create a new route for the review edit page:
```javascript
app.get('/reviews/:id/edit', (req, res) => {
  const reviewId = req.params.id;
  
  // Retrieve the review from the database based on the reviewId
  
  // Render the edit form with the review data
  res.render('edit-review', { review });
});
```

In this example, we handle the GET request to `/reviews/:id/edit`, where `:id` is the review ID. We retrieve the review from the database based on the ID and pass it to the `edit-review` template for rendering.

## Step 3: Create the Edit Form
Now, let's create the form that allows users to update the review content and rating. The form should be pre-filled with the existing review data. Here's an example of how to implement it:

1. Create a new template file, e.g., `edit-review.ejs`, and add the following code:
```html
<form action="/reviews/<%= review.id %>" method="POST">
  <label for="content">Content:</label>
  <textarea name="content" id="content" rows="4" cols="50"><%= review.content %></textarea>

  <label for="rating">Rating:</label>
  <input type="number" name="rating" id="rating" value="<%= review.rating %>" min="1" max="5">

  <button type="submit">Update Review</button>
</form>
```

In this example, we create a form that sends a POST request to `/reviews/:id` to update the review. The form is pre-filled with the existing review's content and rating. The `<%= review.content %>` and `<%= review.rating %>` placeholders are replaced with the actual review data.

## Step 4: Handle the Update
Finally, we need to handle the update request when the user submits the edit form. Here's how to implement it:

1. In your server file, create a route to handle the review update:
```javascript
app.post('/reviews/:id', (req

, res) => {
  const reviewId = req.params.id;
  const updatedContent = req.body.content;
  const updatedRating = req.body.rating;
  
  // Update the review in the database based on the reviewId with the new content and rating
  
  // Redirect the user to the review details page
  res.redirect(`/reviews/${reviewId}`);
});
```

In this example, we handle the POST request to `/reviews/:id`, where `:id` is the review ID. We retrieve the updated content and rating from the form submission (`req.body`) and update the review in the database based on the ID. After the update is complete, we redirect the user to the review details page (`/reviews/${reviewId}`).

## Testing the Implementation
To test the edit button implementation, follow these steps:

1. Start your server by running the following command in your project directory:
```shell
node app.js
```

2. Open your web application in a browser and navigate to a page that displays user reviews.

3. Look for the edit button next to a review that belongs to the currently logged-in user. Click the edit button.

4. You should be redirected to the edit form, where you can update the review content and rating. Make the desired changes and submit the form.

5. The review should be updated in the database, and you should be redirected back to the review details page.

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented an edit button for each user's own reviews. Users can now edit their review content and rating. This feature provides users with the ability to modify their reviews as needed.

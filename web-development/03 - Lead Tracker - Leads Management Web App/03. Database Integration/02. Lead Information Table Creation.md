To store lead information in a structured manner, we need to create a database table. Follow these steps to accomplish this task:

#### Step 1: Open the Database Client

Launch your chosen database client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, DBeaver) and connect to the local development database you set up in the previous task.

#### Step 2: Create a New Table

In the database client, locate the option to create a new table. This is typically found under a "Tables" or "Schema" section. Click on the appropriate option to start creating a new table.

#### Step 3: Define the Table Structure

To define the structure of the table, specify the column names, data types, and any additional constraints for each column.

For example, let's create a table named "leads" with the following columns:

| Column Name   | Data Type    | Constraints       |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| id            | INT          | PRIMARY KEY       |
| name          | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL          |
| email         | VARCHAR(100) | NOT NULL, UNIQUE  |
| phone         | VARCHAR(20)  |                   |
| source        | VARCHAR(50)  |                   |
| created_at    | TIMESTAMP    | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP |

In this example, the "id" column is an integer serving as the primary key. The "name" and "email" columns store lead names and email addresses as strings. The "phone" column stores phone numbers, and the "source" column indicates the source of the lead. Lastly, the "created_at" column stores the timestamp of when the lead was created.

#### Step 4: Execute the Table Creation Statement

Once you have defined the table structure, execute the statement to create the table. The database client typically provides an input area or query editor where you can write and execute SQL statements.

Write the following SQL statement to create the "leads" table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE leads (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  source VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Step 5: Verify the Table Creation

After executing the SQL statement, verify that the table was created successfully. Check the list of tables in your database client, and you should see the newly created "leads" table listed.

#### Step 6: Understand the Table Structure

To better understand the structure of the table, you can examine its details, including the column names, data types, and constraints. This information is typically available in the database client by selecting the "Structure" or "Properties" option for the "leads" table.

#### Step 7: Use the Table in Your Application

Now that the table is created, you can use it to store lead information in your application. Ensure that your application's database connection settings are correctly configured to connect to the local development database.

In your application code, you can perform database operations (e.g., inserting leads, retrieving leads) using SQL queries. Remember to use the appropriate database library or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework based on the programming language and framework you are using.

For example, using the PHP PDO library, you can insert a new lead into the "leads" table with the following code:

```php
<?php
$host = "localhost";
$port = "3306";
$dbName = "lead_management_system";
$username = "your_username";
$password = "your_password

";

try {
  $dsn = "mysql:host=$host;port=$port;dbname=$dbName";
  $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);

  $name = "John Doe";
  $email = "john.doe@example.com";
  $phone = "1234567890";
  $source = "Website";

  $sql = "INSERT INTO leads (name, email, phone, source) VALUES (:name, :email, :phone, :source)";
  $stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);
  $stmt->bindParam(":name", $name);
  $stmt->bindParam(":email", $email);
  $stmt->bindParam(":phone", $phone);
  $stmt->bindParam(":source", $source);
  $stmt->execute();

  echo "Lead inserted successfully!";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
  echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
?>
```

Make sure to replace the database connection details (host, port, dbName, username, password) with your specific configuration.

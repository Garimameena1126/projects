
## Sleep Quality Prediction Command-Line Application

In this guide, we will develop a simple command-line application that takes sleep-related information as input from the user and predicts their sleep quality using a trained machine learning model. Follow the steps below to build the application:

### Step 1: Set Up the Project

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line.

2. Initialize a new Python project by running the following command:
```shell
python -m venv sleep_quality_venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
   ```shell
   sleep_quality_venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - For Unix or Linux:
   ```shell
   source sleep_quality_venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
```shell
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas
```

### Step 2: Load the Trained Model

1. Download or copy the trained machine learning model file (.pkl) into your project directory.

2. Create a new Python file named `sleep_quality_predictor.py`.

3. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd
```

4. Load the trained model from the file:
```python
model = pickle.load(open('path_to_model.pkl', 'rb'))
```
   Replace `'path_to_model.pkl'` with the actual path to your trained model file.

### Step 3: Collect User Input

1. Define a function named `get_user_input()` to collect sleep-related information from the user. This function should prompt the user for inputs such as sleep duration, bedtime routine, exercise, stress levels, etc. and return these values as a dictionary.

   Example:
   ```python
   def get_user_input():
       sleep_duration = input("Enter sleep duration (in hours): ")
       bedtime_routine = input("Enter bedtime routine (yes/no): ")
       exercise = input("Do you exercise regularly? (yes/no): ")
       stress_level = input("Enter stress level (1-10): ")
   
       user_input = {
           'SleepDuration': float(sleep_duration),
           'BedtimeRoutine': bedtime_routine.lower() == 'yes',
           'Exercise': exercise.lower() == 'yes',
           'StressLevel': int(stress_level)
       }
   
       return user_input
   ```

### Step 4: Make Predictions

1. Define a function named `predict_sleep_quality(user_input, model)` to predict the sleep quality based on the user's input and the trained model. This function takes the user input dictionary and the loaded model as arguments and returns the predicted sleep quality.

   Example:
   ```python
   def predict_sleep_quality(user_input, model):
       # Create a DataFrame from the user input
       user_df = pd.DataFrame(user_input, index=[0])
   
       # Perform any necessary preprocessing on the user input DataFrame
       # ...
   
       # Make predictions using the loaded model
       predictions = model.predict(user_df)
   
       return predictions[0]
   ```

### Step 5: Implement the Command-Line Interface

1. Define a function named `main()` to handle the command-line interface. This function should call the `get_user_input()` function to collect user input, then pass the input and the loaded model to the `predict_sleep_quality()` function to obtain the predictions, and finally display the predicted sleep quality to the user.

  

 Example:
   ```python
   def main():
       print("=== Sleep Quality Prediction ===")
       user_input = get_user_input()
       sleep_quality = predict_sleep_quality(user_input, model)
       print(f"Predicted sleep quality: {sleep_quality}")
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()
   ```

### Step 6: Run the Application

1. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to your project directory.

2. Activate the virtual environment if it's not already activated.

3. Run the application by executing the following command:
```shell
python sleep_quality_predictor.py
```

4. The application will prompt you to enter sleep-related information. Provide the required inputs, and the predicted sleep quality will be displayed.

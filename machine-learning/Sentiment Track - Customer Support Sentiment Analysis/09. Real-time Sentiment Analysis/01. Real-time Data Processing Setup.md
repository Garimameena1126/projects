To enable real-time sentiment analysis, we need a streaming data source that provides customer support messages continuously. For this guide, we will use Kafka as the message broker to simulate the streaming data source.

1. Install Kafka by following the official documentation for your operating system.
2. Start the Kafka server.
3. Create a new Kafka topic named "customer_support_messages" by running the following command:
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic customer_support_messages --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
```

## Step 2: Set up Kafka Consumer
In this step, we will set up a Kafka consumer to receive the streaming customer support messages and perform real-time sentiment analysis on them.

1. Create a new Python file named `kafka_consumer.py`.
2. Install the `confluent-kafka` library by running the following command:
```bash
pip install confluent-kafka
```
3. Import the necessary libraries in the `kafka_consumer.py` file:
```python
from confluent_kafka import Consumer, KafkaException, KafkaError
```
4. Define the Kafka consumer configuration:
```python
consumer_config = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'group.id': 'sentiment_analysis_group',
    'auto.offset.reset': 'earliest'
}
```
5. Create a Kafka consumer instance with the provided configuration:
```python
consumer = Consumer(consumer_config)
```
6. Subscribe to the "customer_support_messages" topic:
```python
consumer.subscribe(['customer_support_messages'])
```
7. Set up a loop to continuously consume messages from Kafka and perform sentiment analysis on them:
```python
while True:
    msg = consumer.poll(1.0)

    if msg is None:
        continue

    if msg.error():
        if msg.error().code() == KafkaError._PARTITION_EOF:
            continue
        else:
            print('Consumer error: {}'.format(msg.error()))
            break

    # Perform sentiment analysis on the received message
    sentiment = analyze_sentiment(msg.value().decode('utf-8'))

    print('Received message: {}'.format(msg.value().decode('utf-8')))
    print('Sentiment: {}'.format(sentiment))
```
Note: In the above code snippet, `analyze_sentiment()` is a placeholder function. Replace it with your actual sentiment analysis logic.

## Step 3: Implement Real-time Sentiment Analysis
Now, let's implement the sentiment analysis logic in the `analyze_sentiment()` function. For simplicity, we will use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.

1. Import the necessary libraries in the `kafka_consumer.py` file:
```python
from transformers import pipeline
```
2. Create a sentiment analysis pipeline using the Hugging Face Transformers library:
```python
sentiment_pipeline = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')
```
3. Define the `analyze_sentiment()` function:
```python
def analyze_sentiment(message):
    results = sentiment_pipeline(message)
    sentiment = results[0]['label']
    return sentiment
```
4. Save the changes in the `kafka_consumer.py` file.

## Step 4: Run the Kafka Consumer
In this step, we will run the Kafka consumer to start consuming customer support messages and perform real-time sentiment analysis.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `kafka_consumer.py` file.
3. Run the following command to start the Kafka consumer:
```bash
python kafka_consumer.py
```
4. The consumer will start listening to the Kafka topic and display the received messages along with their sentiments.

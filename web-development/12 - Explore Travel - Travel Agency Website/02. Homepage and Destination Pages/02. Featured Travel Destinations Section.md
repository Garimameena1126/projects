# Adding a Section for Featured Travel Destinations with Images and Descriptions

In this guide, we will focus on adding a section to the homepage of our Travel Agency website that showcases featured travel destinations. Each destination will be accompanied by an image and a brief description to attract the attention of users. This task is part of "Module 2: Homepage and Destination Pages" of the project.

## Step 1: Open the HTML File
1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor of your choice. This file is located inside the `pages` folder of your project.

## Step 2: Add the Featured Destinations Section
1. Inside the `<body>` tags of the `index.html` file, locate the opening and closing `<main>` tags. If they don't exist, add them at an appropriate location within the `<body>` tags.

2. Add the following code inside the `<main>` tags to create the featured destinations section:

```html
<section class="featured-destinations">
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Featured Destinations</h2>
        <div class="destination-card">
            <img src="path/to/destination-image.jpg" alt="Destination Image">
            <h3>Destination 1</h3>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed malesuada ultrices justo, a aliquam velit semper nec.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="destination-card">
            <img src="path/to/destination-image.jpg" alt="Destination Image">
            <h3>Destination 2</h3>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed malesuada ultrices justo, a aliquam velit semper nec.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Add more destination cards as needed -->
    </div>
</section>
```

Let's break down the code:

- `<section class="featured-destinations">`: This creates a `<section>` element with the class "featured-destinations" to define the featured destinations section.
- `<div class="container">`: This creates a `<div>` element with the class "container" to provide a container for the content within the featured destinations section.
- `<h2>Featured Destinations</h2>`: This adds a level-two heading (`<h2>`) for the section title. Modify the title as needed.
- `<div class="destination-card">`: This creates a `<div>` element with the class "destination-card" to represent each destination card.
- `<img src="path/to/destination-image.jpg" alt="Destination Image">`: This adds an image (`<img>`) tag with the path to the destination image. Replace the "path/to/destination-image.jpg" with the actual path to the image file.
- `<h3>Destination 1</h3>`: This adds a level-three heading (`<h3>`) for the destination name. Customize the name for each destination card.
- `<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>`: This adds a paragraph (`<p>`) for the brief description of the destination. Customize the description for each destination card.

Feel free to add more destination cards by duplicating the `<div class="destination-card">` block and modifying the content accordingly.

## Step 3: Style the Featured Destinations Section
1. To style the featured destinations section, you can add CSS code to the `style.css` file located in the `css` folder of your project. If the file doesn't exist, create it inside the `css` folder.

2. Open the `style.css` file in a text editor and add the following code:

```css
/* Style the featured

 destinations section */
.featured-destinations {
  padding: 40px 0;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
}

.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 20px;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 40px;
}

.destination-card {
  text-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 40px;
}

.destination-card img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.destination-card h3 {
  font-size: 24px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.destination-card p {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: #777;
}
```

The code above provides some basic styling for the featured destinations section. It sets the padding and background color for the section, and adjusts the layout of the content within the container. The destination cards are centered with appropriate margins. The images within the destination cards are constrained to the container width, and the headings and descriptions are styled accordingly.

## Step 4: Save the Changes and Review
1. Save the changes made to the `index.html` and `style.css` files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to review the homepage with the added section for featured travel destinations.

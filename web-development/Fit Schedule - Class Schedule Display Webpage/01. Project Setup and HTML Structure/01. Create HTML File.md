## Create a new HTML file named "index.html."

1. Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
2. Create a new file and save it with the name "index.html".
   - For example, in Visual Studio Code, you can go to `File -> New File` and then save the file as "index.html" using `File -> Save` or the shortcut `Ctrl + S`.
3. Begin by setting up the basic structure of the HTML file. In the newly created "index.html" file, start with the following code:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Class Schedule</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   Explanation:
   - The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifies that this is an HTML5 document.
   - The `<html>` element serves as the root element of the HTML file.
   - The `lang="en"` attribute specifies the language of the document (English in this case).
   - The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the HTML document and is not displayed on the webpage.
   - Inside the `<head>` section, the `<meta>` tag sets the character encoding to UTF-8 and configures the viewport for better mobile responsiveness.
   - The `<title>` element sets the title of the webpage, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

4. Save the file.


## User Authentication System

1. Open the JavaScript file associated with your project.

2. Create a form for user registration with input fields for username and password. Here's an example HTML code snippet:

   ```html
   <form id="registrationForm">
     <label for="username">Username:</label>
     <input type="text" id="username" required>
     <label for="password">Password:</label>
     <input type="password" id="password" required>
     <button type="submit">Register</button>
   </form>
   ```

   In the code above, we have a form with input fields for the username and password, along with a submit button.

3. Add an event listener to the registration form that listens for the form submission. In the event handler, retrieve the values entered by the user, create a new user object, and store it in a user database. Here's an example JavaScript code snippet:

   ```javascript
   const registrationForm = document.getElementById('registrationForm');

   registrationForm.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
     event.preventDefault();

     const username = document.getElementById('username').value;
     const password = document.getElementById('password').value;

     // Create a new user object
     const user = {
       username: username,
       password: password,
     };

     // Store the user object in the user database
     // (You can use an array, object, or any other data structure for this purpose)
     userDatabase.push(user);

     // Clear the input fields
     registrationForm.reset();

     // Display a success message or redirect to the login page
     // based on your project's requirements
   });
   ```

   In the code above, we listen for the form submission event using the `addEventListener()` method. We retrieve the values entered by the user and create a new user object. We then store the user object in a user database (which can be an array, object, or any other data structure). Finally, we clear the input fields and handle the success message or redirect based on your project's requirements.

4. Create a form for user login with input fields for username and password. Here's an example HTML code snippet:

   ```html
   <form id="loginForm">
     <label for="username">Username:</label>
     <input type="text" id="username" required>
     <label for="password">Password:</label>
     <input type="password" id="password" required>
     <button type="submit">Login</button>
   </form>
   ```

   Similar to the registration form, the login form includes input fields for the username and password, along with a submit button.

5. Add an event listener to the login form that listens for the form submission. In the event handler, retrieve the values entered by the user, compare them with the user database, and authenticate the user if the credentials match. Here's an example JavaScript code snippet:

   ```javascript
   const loginForm = document.getElementById('loginForm');

   loginForm.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
     event.preventDefault();

     const username = document.getElementById('username').value;
     const password = document.getElementById('password').value;

     // Find the user in the user database based on the username
     const user = userDatabase.find((user) => user.username === username);

     if (user && user.password === password) {
       // Authenticate the user (e.g., set a session or token)
       // Display a success message or redirect to the authenticated area
       // based on your project

's requirements
     } else {
       // Display an error message for invalid credentials
     }

     // Clear the input fields
     loginForm.reset();
   });
   ```

   In the code above, we listen for the form submission event using the `addEventListener()` method. We retrieve the values entered by the user and compare them with the user database using the `find()` method. If the credentials match, you can authenticate the user (e.g., by setting a session or token) and handle the success message or redirect accordingly. If the credentials are invalid, you can display an error message. Finally, we clear the input fields.

6. Test your application by registering new users, logging in with the registered users, and verifying that the authentication system works correctly.

7. Make further adjustments to the code and functionality as needed, based on your project's requirements.

## Summary

In this guide, you learned how to create a user authentication system to allow users to sign up and log in. Here's a summary of the steps:

1. Create a form for user registration with input fields for username and password.
2. Add an event listener to the registration form that stores the entered user data in a user database.
3. Create a form for user login with input fields for username and password.
4. Add an event listener to the login form that authenticates the user based on the entered credentials and the user database.
5. Test your application to ensure that the user authentication system works correctly.
6. Make further adjustments to the code and functionality as needed.

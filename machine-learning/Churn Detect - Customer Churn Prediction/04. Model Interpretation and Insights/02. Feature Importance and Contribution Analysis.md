# Feature Importance and Contribution Analysis

In this guide, we will explore the concept of feature importance and contribution analysis in the context of Churn Detect - Customer Churn Prediction project. Understanding the importance of different features and their contributions towards predicting customer churn can provide valuable insights for making informed business decisions. We will cover the following steps:

1. Importing the Required Libraries
2. Loading the Dataset
3. Preprocessing the Data
4. Training a Churn Prediction Model
5. Analyzing Feature Importance
6. Analyzing Feature Contributions

Let's get started!

## 1. Importing the Required Libraries

Before we begin, we need to import the necessary libraries that will be used throughout the project. In this guide, we will be using the following libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import eli5
from eli5.sklearn import PermutationImportance
```

## 2. Loading the Dataset

Next, we need to load the dataset containing customer churn data. Assuming you have the dataset file (e.g., `churn_data.csv`), you can load it into a Pandas DataFrame as follows:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('churn_data.csv')
```

Make sure to replace `'churn_data.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset file.

## 3. Preprocessing the Data

Before training our churn prediction model, we need to preprocess the data to handle missing values, categorical features, and any other required preprocessing steps. This may involve tasks such as:

- Handling missing values: Impute missing values or drop rows/columns with missing values.
- Encoding categorical features: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- Scaling numerical features: Normalize or standardize numerical features to a common scale.

Ensure that your dataset is properly preprocessed before proceeding to the next steps. The specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the dataset and the nature of the features.

## 4. Training a Churn Prediction Model

To analyze feature importance and contributions, we first need to train a churn prediction model. In this guide, we will use a Random Forest classifier as an example. Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function:

```python
X = df.drop('churn', axis=1)
y = df['churn']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Now, we can train the Random Forest classifier:

```python
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Make sure to replace `'churn'` with the actual column name representing the target variable in your dataset.

## 5. Analyzing Feature Importance

Feature importance analysis helps us understand which features have the most significant impact on predicting customer churn. One way to calculate feature importance is by using permutation importance. Let's calculate and visualize the feature importance:

```python
perm = PermutationImportance(clf, random_state=42).fit(X_test, y_test)
eli5.show_weights(perm, feature_names=X_test.columns.tolist())
```

This will display the feature importance values for each feature in the dataset.

## 6. Analyzing Feature Contributions

In addition to feature importance, we can also analyze the contributions of individual features towards the prediction made by our model. ELI5 library provides a useful tool for this analysis. Let's calculate and visualize the feature contributions for a specific instance:

```python
instance = X_test.iloc[0]  # Choose a specific instance from the test set


eli5.show_prediction(clf, instance, feature_names=X_test.columns.tolist())
```

This will display the feature contributions for the chosen instance, indicating how each feature affected the model's prediction.

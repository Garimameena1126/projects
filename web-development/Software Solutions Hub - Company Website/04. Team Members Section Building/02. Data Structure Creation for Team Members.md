# Creating a Data Structure to Store Team Members' Information

In this task, we will create a data structure to store information about team members, including their names, roles, bios, and photos. This data structure will be used to dynamically display the team members' information on the website. Follow the steps below to complete this task:

## Step 1: Determine the Structure of the Data

1. Decide on the properties you want to include for each team member. Common properties could be:
   - Name: The name of the team member.
   - Role: The role or position of the team member.
   - Bio: A short biography or description of the team member.
   - Photo: The file path or URL to the team member's photo.

## Step 2: Choose a Data Structure

1. Select a suitable data structure to store the team members' information. In JavaScript, an array of objects or a JSON object are commonly used for this purpose. For this guide, we will use an array of objects.
2. Create an empty array to hold the team members' data structure. For example:
   ```javascript
   const teamMembers = [];
   ```

## Step 3: Add Team Members to the Data Structure

1. To add team members to the data structure, follow these steps:
   - Create an object for each team member.
   - Set the desired properties (name, role, bio, photo) for each team member.
   - Push the team member object to the `teamMembers` array.
2. Repeat this process for each team member you want to add. Here's an example:
   ```javascript
   const teamMember1 = {
     name: 'John Doe',
     role: 'CEO',
     bio: 'John Doe is the CEO of our company...',
     photo: 'john-doe.jpg'
   };
   
   const teamMember2 = {
     name: 'Jane Smith',
     role: 'CTO',
     bio: 'Jane Smith is the CTO of our company...',
     photo: 'jane-smith.jpg'
   };
   
   teamMembers.push(teamMember1, teamMember2);
   ```

## Step 4: Test and Iterate

1. You can test the data structure by logging the contents of the `teamMembers` array to the console:
      ```javascript
   console.log(teamMembers);
      ```
2. Verify that the team members' information is stored correctly in the data structure.
3. If necessary, make adjustments to the data structure (e.g., add more team members, modify existing properties) and repeat the testing process until the desired outcome is achieved.

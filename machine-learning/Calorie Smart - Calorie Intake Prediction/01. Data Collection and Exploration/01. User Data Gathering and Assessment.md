1. Start by creating a new Python file called `data_collection.py` to write your code in.

2. Import the necessary libraries for data collection. In this case, we'll use the `pandas` library for data manipulation and the `csv` module for writing data to a CSV file. Add the following import statements at the beginning of your code:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import csv
    ```

3. Define a function called `gather_user_data()` that will handle the data collection process. This function will prompt the user to enter their characteristics, activity level, and dietary information, and then save the data to a CSV file. Add the following code to your script:

    ```python
    def gather_user_data():
        data = {}
    
        # Prompt the user to enter their characteristics
        print("Please enter your characteristics:")
        data['age'] = input("Age: ")
        data['gender'] = input("Gender: ")
        data['weight'] = input("Weight (in kg): ")
        data['height'] = input("Height (in cm): ")
    
        # Prompt the user to enter their activity level
        print("\nPlease enter your activity level:")
        print("1. Sedentary (little or no exercise)")
        print("2. Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week)")
        print("3. Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week)")
        print("4. Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days/week)")
        print("5. Super active (very hard exercise/sports and a physical job)")
        activity_level = int(input("Choose your activity level (1-5): "))
    
        # Convert activity level to a descriptive string
        if activity_level == 1:
            data['activity_level'] = 'sedentary'
        elif activity_level == 2:
            data['activity_level'] = 'lightly active'
        elif activity_level == 3:
            data['activity_level'] = 'moderately active'
        elif activity_level == 4:
            data['activity_level'] = 'very active'
        elif activity_level == 5:
            data['activity_level'] = 'super active'
    
        # Prompt the user to enter their dietary information
        print("\nPlease enter your dietary information:")
        data['dietary_info'] = input("Dietary information: ")
    
        # Save the data to a CSV file
        with open('user_data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
            writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=data.keys())
            writer.writeheader()
            writer.writerow(data)
    
        print("User data saved successfully!")
    
    # Call the function to gather user data
    gather_user_data()
    ```

4. Save the file and run the script. It will prompt the user to enter their characteristics, activity level, and dietary information. After the user provides the input, the data will be saved to a CSV file named `user_data.csv`.

5. Verify that the data is correctly saved by opening the `user_data.csv` file. It should contain a row with the user's information, including age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and dietary information.

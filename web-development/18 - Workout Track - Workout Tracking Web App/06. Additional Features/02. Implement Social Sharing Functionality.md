# Implement Social Sharing Functionality

In this task, we will enhance the Workout Tracking App by implementing social sharing functionality. This feature will allow users to share their achievements with others on various social media platforms. Follow the step-by-step guide below to implement this feature:

## Step 1: Obtain Social Media API Keys

To enable social sharing functionality, we need to obtain API keys from the social media platforms we want to integrate with. In this example, we will use the Facebook API for sharing achievements. Follow these steps to obtain the required API keys:

1. Visit the Facebook Developer website at [https://developers.facebook.com/](https://developers.facebook.com/) and sign in with your Facebook account.

2. Create a new app by clicking on the "My Apps" dropdown menu and selecting "Create App."

3. Choose the platform as "Website" and provide a name for your app.

4. After creating the app, you will be redirected to the app dashboard. From the left sidebar, select "Settings" and then navigate to the "Basic" tab.

5. Note down the "App ID" and "App Secret" values. These are the API keys we will use to authenticate with Facebook.

6. Additionally, configure the "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" field by adding the URL where the user will be redirected after successful authentication. For example, if your app is running on `http://localhost:3000`, enter `http://localhost:3000/auth/facebook/callback`.

## Step 2: Set Up Authentication

To enable users to log in using their social media accounts, we need to implement authentication with Facebook. Follow these steps to set up authentication:

1. Install the required dependencies for authentication with Facebook. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Then run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install passport passport-facebook express-session
   ```

2. In your project directory, create a new folder called `config`. Inside the `config` folder, create a new file called `passport.js`. This file will contain the configuration for passport.js, a library that simplifies authentication in Node.js.

3. Open the `passport.js` file and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   const passport = require('passport');
   const FacebookStrategy = require('passport-facebook').Strategy;

   passport.use(
     new FacebookStrategy(
       {
         clientID: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
         clientSecret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
         callbackURL: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/facebook/callback',
       },
       (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
         // Handle the authentication callback
         // Save user details or perform any necessary operations
         // Call done() to indicate successful authentication
       }
     )
   );
   ```

   Replace `'YOUR_APP_ID'` and `'YOUR_APP_SECRET'` with the actual values from your Facebook app.

4. In your project's entry file (usually `index.js` or `app.js`), require the `passport.js` file and set up passport middleware. Add the following code at the top of the file:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const passport = require('passport');
   const session = require('express-session');
   const app = express();

   // Set up session middleware
   app.use(
     session({
       secret: 'YOUR_SESSION_SECRET',
       resave: false,
       saveUninitialized: false,
     })
   );

   // Set up passport middleware
   app.use(passport.initialize());
   app.use(passport.session());

   // Passport configuration
   require('./config/passport');
   ```

   Replace `'YOUR_SESSION_SECRET'` with a secret key used to encrypt session data.

5. Add routes

 to handle Facebook authentication. Create a new file called `auth.js` in your project's `routes` directory. Inside the `auth.js` file, add the following code:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const passport = require('passport');
   const router = express.Router();

   // Redirect the user to Facebook for authentication
   router.get('/auth/facebook', passport.authenticate('facebook'));

   // Facebook authentication callback
   router.get(
     '/auth/facebook/callback',
     passport.authenticate('facebook', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
     (req, res) => {
       // Redirect the user to the home page or any desired route
       res.redirect('/');
     }
   );

   module.exports = router;
   ```

6. In your project's entry file, require the `auth.js` file and register the authentication routes. Add the following code below the passport middleware setup:

   ```javascript
   const authRoutes = require('./routes/auth');

   // Register authentication routes
   app.use('/', authRoutes);
   ```

## Step 3: Implement Social Sharing

Now that we have set up authentication with Facebook, we can proceed to implement the social sharing functionality. Follow these steps to enable users to share their achievements:

1. Install the necessary dependencies for social sharing. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```

2. Create a new file called `share.js` in your project's `routes` directory. This file will handle the sharing functionality. Inside `share.js`, add the following code:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();
   const axios = require('axios');

   // Handle the share request
   router.post('/share', (req, res) => {
     const { userId, achievement } = req.body;

     // Perform any necessary logic to prepare the achievement for sharing

     // Make a POST request to the Facebook API to share the achievement
     axios
       .post(
         `https://graph.facebook.com/${userId}/feed`,
         {
           message: `I just achieved ${achievement} using the Workout Tracking App!`,
           access_token: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
         }
       )
       .then((response) => {
         // Handle the response from the Facebook API
         res.status(200).json({ success: true });
       })
       .catch((error) => {
         // Handle any errors that occurred during the request
         res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to share achievement' });
       });
   });

   module.exports = router;
   ```

   Replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'` with a valid access token obtained by authenticating with Facebook. You can retrieve the access token in the authentication callback and store it in the user's session or database.

3. In your project's entry file, require the `share.js` file and register the sharing route. Add the following code below the authentication route registration:

   ```javascript
   const shareRoutes = require('./routes/share');

   // Register sharing route
   app.use('/api', shareRoutes);
   ```

   The sharing route will be accessible at `/api/share`.

4. In your front-end code, implement a functionality to trigger the sharing request. This could be a button or any other user interaction. When the user triggers the sharing action, send a POST request to `/api/share` with the necessary data (e.g., the user's ID and the achievement to share).

   ```javascript
   // Example using fetch API to send a POST request
   fetch('/api/share', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    

 body: JSON.stringify({ userId: 'USER_ID', achievement: 'Completed 10km run' }),
   })
     .then((response) => {
       // Handle the response from the server
       if (response.ok) {
         console.log('Achievement shared successfully!');
       } else {
         console.error('Failed to share achievement.');
       }
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // Handle any errors that occurred during the request
       console.error('An error occurred while sharing the achievement:', error);
     });
   ```

   Replace `'USER_ID'` and `'Completed 10km run'` with the actual user ID and achievement data.

# Creating a RESTful API Endpoint for Review Submissions using Express.js

In this guide, we will focus on creating a RESTful API endpoint using Express.js to handle review submissions for your reviews and ratings system. We will provide step-by-step instructions and code examples to help beginners create the API endpoint.

## Step 1: Set up the Server

Before creating the API endpoint, make sure you have already set up a server using Express.js. If you haven't done so yet, refer to the previous guide on "Setting up a Server using Express.js" to complete this step.

## Step 2: Create the API Endpoint

Open the `server.js` file (or the file where you set up your server) and add the following code to create a POST endpoint for review submissions:

```javascript
app.post('/api/reviews', (req, res) => {
  // Handle review submission logic here
});
```

In this code, we use the `app.post()` method to define a route for the API endpoint. The route path `/api/reviews` indicates that this endpoint is responsible for handling review submissions. The callback function `(req, res) => { ... }` will be executed when a POST request is made to this endpoint.

## Step 3: Handle Review Submission Logic

Inside the callback function, we will handle the logic for processing the review submission. This may involve validating the data, storing it in a database, and sending a response back to the client.

### Example: Handling Review Submission

To handle the review submission, add the following code to the callback function:

```javascript
app.post('/api/reviews', (req, res) => {
  const review = req.body; // Assuming the review data is sent in the request body

  // Perform server-side validation on the review data
  if (!review.title || !review.content) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: 'Title and content are required fields.' });
    return;
  }

  // Store the review in the database or perform any other required operations

  res.status(201).json({ message: 'Review submitted successfully!' });
});
```

In this example, we assume that the review data is sent in the request body. We access the review data using `req.body`. You may need to use additional middleware (such as `body-parser` or `express.json()`) to parse the request body properly.

We then perform server-side validation on the review data. If any required fields are missing (`title` or `content` in this example), we send a 400 (Bad Request) response with an error message using `res.status(400).json({ error: '...' })`.

If the validation passes, you can store the review data in a database or perform any other required operations.

Finally, we send a 201 (Created) response with a success message using `res.status(201).json({ message: '...' })`.

## Step 4: Test the API Endpoint

To test the API endpoint, you can use tools like cURL, Postman, or any HTTP client library. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/api/reviews` (replace `3000` with your server's port if different) with the necessary review data in the request body.

If the request is successful and the validation passes, you should receive a 201 (Created) response with the success message. If the validation fails, you should receive a 400 (Bad Request) response with the error message.

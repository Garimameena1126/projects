# Create User Profile Pages to Display Logged Exercises per User

In this task, we will focus on creating user profile pages that display the logged exercises specific to each user. These profile pages will provide a personalized view for users to track their exercise history. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Design User Profile Page

Before implementing the functionality, design the user profile page layout and structure. Consider including elements such as the user's profile picture, username, and a section to display the logged exercises.

```html
<!-- HTML structure for the user profile page -->
<h1>User Profile</h1>

<div class="profile">
  <img src="profile_picture.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
  <h2>Username</h2>
</div>

<div class="exercise-history">
  <h3>Exercise History</h3>
  <ul>
    <!-- Logged exercises will be dynamically added here -->
  </ul>
</div>
```

In this example, we have a basic HTML structure for the user profile page. The user's profile picture and username will be displayed in the `profile` section, while the logged exercises will be shown in the `exercise-history` section. The logged exercises will be dynamically added to the `<ul>` element.

## Step 2: Retrieve User-Specific Exercise Data

To display the logged exercises per user, we need to retrieve the user-specific exercise data from the database. Ensure that you have implemented the necessary backend API endpoints to handle this request.

```javascript
// Example API call to retrieve user-specific exercise data
function fetchExerciseHistory(userId) {
  // Replace 'API_URL' with the actual URL of the backend API endpoint
  fetch(`API_URL/users/${userId}/exercises`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      // Process the retrieved exercise data
      displayExerciseHistory(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the API call
      console.error('Error retrieving exercise history:', error);
    });
}
```

In this example, we use the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the backend API endpoint that retrieves the user-specific exercise data. Replace `'API_URL'` with the actual URL of your backend API endpoint. Once the data is retrieved successfully, the `displayExerciseHistory` function is called with the exercise data as a parameter.

## Step 3: Display Exercise History

In the `displayExerciseHistory` function, process the retrieved exercise data and dynamically add the logged exercises to the user profile page.

```javascript
function displayExerciseHistory(exerciseData) {
  const exerciseList = document.querySelector('.exercise-history ul');

  // Clear any existing exercise entries
  exerciseList.innerHTML = '';

  // Loop through the exercise data and create list items
  exerciseData.forEach(exercise => {
    const listItem = document.createElement('li');
    listItem.textContent = exercise.name;
    exerciseList.appendChild(listItem);
  });
}
```

In this example, the `exerciseData` array contains objects representing logged exercises. We use JavaScript's DOM manipulation methods to create `<li>` elements for each exercise and append them to the `<ul>` element. The exercise name is set as the text content of each list item.

## Step 4: User Authentication and Routing

To ensure that only authenticated users can access their respective user profile pages, implement user authentication and routing functionality. This will prevent unauthorized access and redirect users to the appropriate pages based on their authentication status.

Refer to the documentation or resources for your chosen web framework or library to implement user authentication and routing functionality specific to your project


## Create a Landing Page

In this task, we will create a landing page for the Fitness Goal Tracker web application. The landing page will welcome users and provide an introduction to the application.

### Step 1: Set up the Project

1. Create a new directory for your project on your local machine.
2. Open a command-line interface (CLI) in the project directory.
3. Initialize a new frontend project using your preferred framework. For example, if you are using React, you can run the following command:
   ```shell
   npx create-react-app fitness-goal-tracker
   ```
   This command will set up a new React project with the name "fitness-goal-tracker".
4. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd fitness-goal-tracker
   ```

### Step 2: Create the Basic Structure

1. Open your preferred code editor and navigate to the project directory.
2. Locate the `src` directory and create a new file called `index.html` in it.
3. Add the basic HTML structure to the `index.html` file:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Fitness Goal Tracker</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     </head>
     <body>
       <header>
         <!-- Navigation bar will be added in a later step -->
       </header>
       
       <main>
         <section class="landing">
           <h1>Welcome to the Fitness Goal Tracker!</h1>
           <p>Track and achieve your fitness goals with ease.</p>
           <!-- Additional content for the landing page can be added here -->
         </section>
       </main>
       
       <footer>
         <!-- Footer content will be added in a later step -->
       </footer>
       
       <script src="scripts.js"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

### Step 3: Add Styling

1. In the same `src` directory, create a new file called `styles.css`.
2. Open the `styles.css` file and add the following CSS code to style the landing page:
   ```css
   /* Reset some default styles */
   body, h1, p {
     margin: 0;
     padding: 0;
   }
   
   /* Basic styling for the landing page */
   .landing {
     text-align: center;
     margin: 50px auto;
   }
   
   h1 {
     font-size: 36px;
     margin-bottom: 10px;
   }
   
   p {
     font-size: 18px;
   }
   ```
   
### Step 4: Set up Navigation Bar and Footer

1. Open the `index.html` file in your code editor.
2. In the `<header>` section, add the following HTML code for the navigation bar:
   ```html
   <nav>
     <ul>
       <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
       <!-- Add additional navigation links as needed -->
     </ul>
   </nav>
   ```
3. In the `<footer>` section, add the following HTML code for the footer:
   ```html
   <p>&copy; 2023 Fitness Goal Tracker. All rights reserved.</p>
   ```
   
### Step 5: Test the Landing Page

1. Open the command-line interface (CLI) in the project directory.
2. Start the development server by running the following command:
   ```shell
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the URL provided by your framework).
4. You should see the landing page with the "Welcome to the Fitness Goal Tracker!" heading and the introductory text.

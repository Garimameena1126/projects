# Module 3: Model Selection and Training

In this module, we will focus on selecting an appropriate classification model for sleep quality classification. We will explore three popular models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). We will also cover the steps to split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets, and finally, train the selected model using the training data.

## Step 1: Import the Required Libraries

Before we start, let's import the necessary libraries for our project. In this guide, we will be using scikit-learn and Keras for model selection and training. Open your Python environment and import the following libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
```

## Step 2: Load the Preprocessed Data

Assuming you have already completed the data preprocessing and feature engineering steps mentioned in Module 2, we will proceed with loading the preprocessed data. Make sure you have the preprocessed dataset in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel). Use the following code to load the data into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
# Load the preprocessed data into a DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_data.csv')
```

Replace `'preprocessed_data.csv'` with the path or filename of your preprocessed dataset.

## Step 3: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

To evaluate the performance of our models, we need to split the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to assess its generalization on unseen data. Use the following code to perform the data split:

```python
# Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = data.drop('sleep_quality', axis=1)  # Features
y = data['sleep_quality']  # Target variable

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Here, `X` represents the feature matrix without the target variable, and `y` represents the target variable (sleep quality). Adjust the `test_size` parameter according to your preference for the split ratio.

## Step 4: Train the Logistic Regression Model

The first model we will train is Logistic Regression, which is a popular linear classification algorithm. It's a good starting point for binary classification problems like sleep quality classification. Use the following code to train the Logistic Regression model:

```python
# Create an instance of the Logistic Regression model
logreg = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model on the training data
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

That's it! You have trained the Logistic Regression model using the training data.

## Step 5: Train the Random Forest Model

The second model we will explore is Random Forest, an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It can capture complex relationships and handle a large number of features effectively. Train the Random Forest model using the following code:

```python
# Create an instance of the Random Forest model
rf = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model on the training data
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Great! You have trained the Random Forest model using the training data.

## Step 6: Train the LSTM Model

Lastly, we will train an LSTM model, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for sequence data. LSTMs are commonly used for analyzing

 time-series data and can potentially capture temporal dependencies in sleep-related features. Train the LSTM model using the following code:

```python
# Reshape the input data for LSTM (assuming a 3D tensor input shape)
X_train_lstm = X_train.values.reshape(X_train.shape[0], 1, X_train.shape[1])
X_test_lstm = X_test.values.reshape(X_test.shape[0], 1, X_test.shape[1])

# Create an instance of the LSTM model
lstm = Sequential()

# Add LSTM layer and a dense output layer
lstm.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(1, X_train.shape[1])))
lstm.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
lstm.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model on the training data
lstm.fit(X_train_lstm, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

In this code snippet, we assume that your input data has a 3D tensor shape, where the first dimension represents the number of samples, the second dimension represents the time steps (set to 1 in our case), and the third dimension represents the number of features.

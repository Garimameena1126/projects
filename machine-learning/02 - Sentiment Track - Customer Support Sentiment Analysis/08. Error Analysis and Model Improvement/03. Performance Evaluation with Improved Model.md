# Module 8: Error Analysis and Model Improvement

## Task: Evaluate the Impact of Model Improvements on Overall Performance

In this task, we will analyze the impact of model improvements on the overall performance of our sentiment analysis model. By fine-tuning the model and incorporating additional features or adjusting the classification thresholds, we aim to enhance its accuracy and effectiveness. We will follow a step-by-step approach to evaluate these improvements and assess their impact.

### Step 1: Analyze Misclassified Samples

To understand the common errors made by our sentiment analysis model, we need to analyze the misclassified samples. These samples will provide insights into the patterns or characteristics that the model struggles to classify correctly. By identifying these patterns, we can make informed decisions to improve the model's performance.

Here's how you can analyze misclassified samples:

1. Load the testing dataset that contains the customer support messages and their true sentiment labels.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the testing dataset
   testing_data = pd.read_csv('testing_data.csv')
   ```

2. Make predictions on the testing dataset using your trained sentiment analysis model.

   ```python
   # Assuming you have a trained model named 'sentiment_model'
   predictions = sentiment_model.predict(testing_data['message'])
   ```

3. Compare the predicted labels with the true labels in the testing dataset to identify misclassified samples.

   ```python
   misclassified_samples = testing_data[predictions != testing_data['sentiment']]
   ```

4. Analyze the misclassified samples by examining the text and associated labels. Look for patterns, common errors, or specific types of messages that the model struggles with.

   ```python
   for index, sample in misclassified_samples.iterrows():
       print(f"Message: {sample['message']}")
       print(f"True Sentiment: {sample['sentiment']}")
       print(f"Predicted Sentiment: {predictions[index]}\n")
   ```

   By analyzing the misclassified samples, you may discover patterns such as certain keywords, phrases, or linguistic nuances that the model fails to capture accurately.

### Step 2: Fine-tune the Model

Based on the analysis of misclassified samples, we can take steps to fine-tune the model. There are several approaches to consider when improving the model's performance:

1. Incorporate Additional Features:
   - Explore the possibility of including additional features that might provide valuable information for sentiment analysis. For example, you could consider incorporating features such as message length, punctuation usage, or the presence of specific keywords.
   - Extract these features from the text data and concatenate them with the existing features used during training.
   - Revisit the training process, including the newly added features, to update the sentiment analysis model.

   ```python
   # Extract additional features from the text data (example: message length)
   testing_data['message_length'] = testing_data['message'].apply(len)

   # Concatenate the additional features with existing features
   additional_features = testing_data[['message_length']]

   # Make predictions using the updated model
   predictions = sentiment_model.predict(additional_features)
   ```

2. Adjust Classification Thresholds:
   - Experiment with different classification thresholds to find the optimal balance between precision and recall.
   - By adjusting the threshold, you can control the model's sensitivity in classifying sentiment labels.
   - Evaluate the impact of threshold adjustments on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

   ```python
   # Assuming you have probability scores for each class
   threshold = 0.5  # Adjust this threshold value

   # Convert probability scores to predicted labels based on the adjusted threshold
   predictions = (predictions[:, 1] >= threshold

).astype(int)
   ```

   Iterate and evaluate the model's performance by adjusting the threshold and observing the changes in evaluation metrics.

### Step 3: Evaluate Model Improvement

After fine-tuning the model and incorporating additional features or adjusting the classification thresholds, it is crucial to evaluate the impact of these improvements on the model's overall performance. This evaluation helps us determine whether the changes have resulted in a more accurate and reliable sentiment analysis model.

Follow these steps to evaluate the model improvement:

1. Calculate evaluation metrics on the testing dataset using the updated model.

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

   # Assuming you have true labels for the testing dataset
   true_labels = testing_data['sentiment']

   # Calculate evaluation metrics
   accuracy = accuracy_score(true_labels, predictions)
   precision = precision_score(true_labels, predictions)
   recall = recall_score(true_labels, predictions)
   f1 = f1_score(true_labels, predictions)

   print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
   print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
   print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
   print(f"F1-Score: {f1:.2f}")
   ```

2. Compare the evaluation metrics before and after the model improvement to assess the impact of the changes.

   ```python
   # Assuming you have metrics calculated before the model improvement
   previous_accuracy = 0.85
   previous_precision = 0.83
   previous_recall = 0.87
   previous_f1 = 0.85

   print("Before Model Improvement:")
   print(f"Accuracy: {previous_accuracy:.2f}")
   print(f"Precision: {previous_precision:.2f}")
   print(f"Recall: {previous_recall:.2f}")
   print(f"F1-Score: {previous_f1:.2f}\n")

   print("After Model Improvement:")
   print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
   print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
   print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
   print(f"F1-Score: {f1:.2f}")
   ```

   By comparing the metrics before and after the model improvement, you can determine whether the changes have had a positive impact on the sentiment analysis model's performance.

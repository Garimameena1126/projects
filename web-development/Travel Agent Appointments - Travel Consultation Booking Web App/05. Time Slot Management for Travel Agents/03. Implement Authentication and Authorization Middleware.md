1. **Set up user authentication**: Before implementing the middleware, you need to set up user authentication in your application. This typically involves creating a user registration and login system, as well as storing user credentials securely.

   There are several libraries and frameworks available to handle user authentication, such as Passport.js, Firebase Authentication, or implementing your own custom authentication system. Choose the approach that best suits your project requirements.

   Once the user authentication is set up, ensure that you have a user model/schema with the necessary fields to store user information, including the newly added role field.

2. **Create an authentication middleware**: To restrict access to the time slot management interface, you need to create a middleware function that checks if the user is authenticated. This middleware will be applied to the routes that require authentication.

   Here's an example of how to create an authentication middleware using Express.js and Passport.js:

   ```javascript
   // authenticationMiddleware.js
   
   function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
     if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
       // User is authenticated, proceed to the next middleware or route handler
       return next();
     }
   
     // User is not authenticated, redirect them to the login page or send an error response
     res.redirect('/login');
   }
   
   module.exports = isAuthenticated;
   ```

   In the code above, the middleware function `isAuthenticated` checks if the user is authenticated using the `req.isAuthenticated()` method provided by Passport.js. If the user is authenticated, it calls the `next()` function to proceed to the next middleware or route handler. Otherwise, it redirects the user to the login page. Adjust the code based on your authentication library or implementation.

3. **Apply the authentication middleware**: Once the authentication middleware is created, you can apply it to the routes that require authentication. In this case, you need to apply it to the routes that serve the time slot management interface.

   Here's an example of how to apply the authentication middleware to a route using Express.js:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const isAuthenticated = require('./authenticationMiddleware');
   
   // ...
   
   // Apply the authentication middleware to the time slot management route
   app.get('/travel-agent/time-slots', isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
     // Handle the request and render the time slot management interface
     res.render('travel-agent-time-slots');
   });
   ```

   In the code above, the `isAuthenticated` middleware function is applied as a second argument to the route handler for the time slot management interface. Adjust the code based on your specific server application and routing configuration.

4. **Implement authorization checks**: Besides authentication, you may also need to implement authorization checks to ensure that only travel agents with the appropriate role can access the time slot management interface.

   This typically involves checking the user's role against the required role(s) for accessing the interface. You can retrieve the user's role from the authenticated user object or the user's session.

   Here's an example of how to implement authorization checks in the authentication middleware:

   ```javascript
   function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
     if (req.isAuthenticated() && req.user.role === 'travel-agent') {
       // User is authenticated as a travel agent, proceed to the next middleware or route handler
       return next();
     }
   
     // User is not authenticated as a travel agent, redirect them to the appropriate page or send an error response
     res.redirect('/unauthorized');
   }
   ```

   In the code above, the middleware checks if the user is authenticated and has the role of "travel-agent." Adjust the code based on your user model/schema and authentication implementation.

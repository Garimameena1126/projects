Follow the steps below to set up a backend server using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB:

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

1. Create a new project folder on your local machine.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:
   ```shell
   npm init -y
   ```
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   ```shell
   npm install express mongoose
   ```

## Step 2: Create the Server File

1. Create a new file in the project folder and name it `server.js`.
2. Open `server.js` and import the required modules:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   ```
3. Create an instance of the Express application:
   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   ```
4. Set up the middleware to parse incoming JSON data:
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.json());
   ```
5. Define a test route to check if the server is running:
   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Server is running.');
   });
   ```
6. Start the server and listen on a specified port:
   ```javascript
   const port = 3000;
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}.`);
   });
   ```

## Step 3: Connect to the MongoDB Database

1. Require the `mongoose` module and establish a connection to the MongoDB database:
   ```javascript
   mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/newsdb', {
     useNewUrlParser: true,
     useUnifiedTopology: true,
   });
   ```
   - Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine.
   - Replace `'newsdb'` with the name you want to give to your database.

## Step 4: Test the Server

1. Save the `server.js` file.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
3. Start the server by running the following command:
   ```shell
   node server.js
   ```
4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).
5. You should see the message "Server is running." This confirms that the server is set up and running successfully.
6. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server.

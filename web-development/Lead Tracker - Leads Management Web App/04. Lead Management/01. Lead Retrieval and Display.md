To retrieve leads from the database and display them in a table, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Establish a Database Connection

Before retrieving leads, establish a connection between your application and the database. Refer to the previous guide on how to establish a connection and make sure to follow the steps mentioned there.

## Step 2: Fetch Leads from the Database

Write a query to fetch the leads from the database. The query should select the desired columns and specify any conditions or sorting requirements.

For example, using SQL syntax, a sample select query might look like this:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, phone FROM leads;
```

This query retrieves the `id`, `name`, `email`, and `phone` columns from the `leads` table. Customize the query based on your table structure and desired columns.

## Step 3: Execute the Select Query

Using the database connection established in Step 1, execute the select query to fetch the leads from the database.

Refer to the documentation or appropriate guides for your chosen database driver or library to learn how to execute queries.

For example, using Python with the `mysql` driver, you would execute the select query as follows:

```python
cursor = connection.cursor()
select_query = "SELECT id, name, email, phone FROM leads"
cursor.execute(select_query)
leads = cursor.fetchall()
```

The `fetchall()` method retrieves all the rows returned by the query.

## Step 4: Display Leads in a Table

To display the retrieved leads in a table format, you can utilize HTML and CSS in conjunction with a template engine or framework.

Here's an example of how you can structure the HTML table to display the leads:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Email</th>
      <th>Phone</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <!-- Loop through the leads and generate rows dynamically -->
    {% for lead in leads %}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ lead.id }}</td>
      <td>{{ lead.name }}</td>
      <td>{{ lead.email }}</td>
      <td>{{ lead.phone }}</td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Make sure to replace the template syntax (`{% %}` and `{{ }}`) with the appropriate syntax for your chosen template engine or framework.

## Step 5: Integrate with Your Application

Integrate the HTML table with your application's views or templates. Depending on your programming language or framework, this step may vary.

For example, in a web application using Python with the Flask framework, you might pass the retrieved leads to the template engine using a view function:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/leads')
def show_leads():
  # Fetch leads from the database (Step 3)
  # ...
  return render_template('leads.html', leads=leads)
```

Ensure that the `leads` variable is properly passed to the template engine for rendering.

## Step 6: Test and Verify

Test your application and navigate to the appropriate route or page to view the leads. Verify that the leads are displayed correctly in the table format.

Make any necessary adjustments to the HTML or integration code if the leads are not displaying as expected.

# Step-by-Step Guide: Implementing a Database to Store Exercise Records

In this task, we will implement a database to store exercise records. We will use MongoDB as our database solution and integrate it with our backend server. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Prerequisites

- Backend server set up using a web framework (e.g., Node.js with Express)
- MongoDB installed and running on your system

## Steps

1. **Install the MongoDB Driver**

   Open your project directory in a terminal or command prompt and install the MongoDB driver for Node.js using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install mongodb
   ```

   This will install the necessary dependencies to interact with MongoDB from your Node.js application.

2. **Set Up the Database Connection**

   In your backend server code (e.g., `server.js`), import the MongoDB client and set up the database connection. Add the following code at the top of the file:

   ```javascript
   const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

   // Connection URI for MongoDB
   const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/exercise-tracker';

   // Create a new MongoClient
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

   // Connect to the MongoDB server
   client.connect((err) => {
     if (err) {
       console.error('Failed to connect to the database:', err);
       return;
     }

     // Start the server once the database connection is established
     app.listen(3000, () => {
       console.log('Server started on port 3000');
     });
   });
   ```

   In this code, we import the `MongoClient` from the MongoDB driver. We then define the connection URI for MongoDB, which specifies the address of the MongoDB server and the name of the database (in this example, `exercise-tracker`). Next, we create a new instance of the `MongoClient` and connect to the MongoDB server. If the connection is successful, the server starts listening on port 3000.

3. **Define a Model for Exercises**

   Create a new file called `exercise.js` in a `models` directory (create the directory if it doesn't exist). In `exercise.js`, define a model for exercises using the following code:

   ```javascript
   const { ObjectId } = require('mongodb');

   class Exercise {
     constructor(name, duration, calories) {
       this._id = new ObjectId();
       this.name = name;
       this.duration = duration;
       this.calories = calories;
     }
   }

   module.exports = Exercise;
   ```

   In this code, we define a `Exercise` class with properties for `_id` (a unique identifier generated using `ObjectId` from the MongoDB driver), `name`, `duration`, and `calories`. This class represents an exercise record in our database.

4. **Insert an Exercise Record**

   In your backend server code, add the following code to insert an exercise record into the database:

   ```javascript
   const Exercise = require('./models/exercise');

   app.post('/exercises', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const { name, duration, calories } = req.body;
       const exercise = new Exercise(name, duration, calories);

       // Insert the exercise record into the "exercises" collection
       const db = client.db();
       const result = await db.collection('exercises').insertOne(exercise);

       res.status(201).json({ message: 'Exercise saved successfully', id: result.insertedId });
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to save exercise' });


     }
   });
   ```

   In this code, we import the `Exercise` model from the `exercise.js` file. Inside the `/exercises` route handler, we extract the `name`, `duration`, and `calories` from the request body. We create a new instance of the `Exercise` class with the extracted data.

   We then access the database using `client.db()` and use the `collection` method to access the "exercises" collection. We call `insertOne` to insert the exercise record into the collection and store the result.

   If the insertion is successful, we send a success response with a status code of 201 (Created) and a JSON message containing the success message and the inserted exercise's ID. If an error occurs, we send a failure response with a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error) and an error message.

5. **Retrieve Exercise Records**

   In your backend server code, add the following code to retrieve exercise records from the database:

   ```javascript
   app.get('/exercises', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       // Retrieve all exercise records from the "exercises" collection
       const db = client.db();
       const exercises = await db.collection('exercises').find().toArray();

       res.json(exercises);
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve exercises' });
     }
   });
   ```

   In this code, inside the `/exercises` route handler, we access the database using `client.db()` and use the `collection` method to access the "exercises" collection. We call `find` to retrieve all exercise records from the collection and `toArray` to convert the result into an array.

   If the retrieval is successful, we send a response with the retrieved exercises in JSON format. If an error occurs, we send a failure response with a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error) and an error message.

6. **Test the API Endpoints**

   Restart your backend server if necessary. You can use tools such as Postman or curl to test the API endpoints.

   - To test the `POST /exercises` endpoint, send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/exercises` with a JSON payload containing the exercise data. For example:

     ```json
     {
       "name": "Push-ups",
       "duration": 10,
       "calories": 50
     }
     ```

     Verify that you receive a success response indicating that the exercise was saved.

   - To test the `GET /exercises` endpoint, send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/exercises`. Verify that you receive a response containing the list of exercises.

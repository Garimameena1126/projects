In this task, we will focus on applying media queries to adapt the layout and styles of your website for different breakpoints. Media queries allow you to define specific CSS rules based on the characteristics of the user's device or viewport size. Follow the steps below to accomplish this.

1. Identify Breakpoints
   - Determine the breakpoints at which you want to adapt the layout of your website.
   - Breakpoints are specific screen sizes where the layout or design needs to change.
   - Common breakpoints include mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
   - Consider the different devices and screen sizes you want to optimize your website for.

2. Add the Media Query Syntax
   - Open the CSS file of your project where you define the styles.
   - Within the CSS file, add the media query syntax to apply styles specific to breakpoints.
   - The media query syntax begins with `@media` followed by the condition in parentheses.
   - Inside the media query block, specify the CSS rules that should apply when the condition is met.

3. Define Media Query Conditions
   - Determine the conditions based on which you want the styles to apply.
   - Common conditions include `max-width`, `min-width`, `orientation`, etc.
   - Use the `max-width` condition to target smaller screens and apply mobile-specific styles.
   - Use the `min-width` condition to target larger screens and apply desktop-specific styles.
   - You can combine multiple conditions to create more specific rules.

4. Apply Styles Within Media Queries
   - Inside the media query block, write the CSS rules that should apply for the specified conditions.
   - Modify the existing styles or add new styles to adapt the layout and design.
   - Use the same selectors and properties as you would outside the media queries.
   - However, the styles defined within the media queries will only apply when the condition is met.

5. Test and Adjust
   - Save the CSS file and reload your website in the browser.
   - Open the browser's developer tools and use the device emulation mode to simulate different screen sizes.
   - Verify that the styles change appropriately as you resize the browser window or simulate different devices.
   - Make adjustments to the media queries and styles as needed to achieve the desired layout and design at each breakpoint.
   - Test on multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent and responsive experience.

### Example Code Snippet:
```css
/* Example of a media query for mobile devices */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  /* Styles for mobile */
  .container {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  
  .menu {
    display: none;
  }
  
  .logo {
    text-align: center;
  }
}
```

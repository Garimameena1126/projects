# Setting up a Server Using Node.js with Express

In this task, we will set up a server using the Node.js runtime environment and the Express framework. The server will handle incoming HTTP requests and provide the necessary backend functionality for our project. Follow the steps below to set up the server.

## Step 1: Initialize the Project

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new project directory by running the following command:

```bash
mkdir backend
```

3. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

4. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will create a new `package.json` file in the project directory with default configurations.

## Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

1. Install the Express framework by running the following command:

```bash
npm install express
```

This will download and install Express and its dependencies in the project.

## Step 3: Create the Server File

1. Create a new file named `server.js` in the project directory.
2. Open `server.js` in a text editor or code editor of your choice.

## Step 4: Set up the Express Server

1. Add the following code to `server.js` to set up the Express server:

```javascript
// Import the required modules
const express = require('express');

// Create an instance of the Express application
const app = express();
const port = 3000; // Specify the desired port number

// Define the route handlers
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!'); // Respond with a simple message
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this code, we import the `express` module and create an instance of the Express application. We define a route handler for the root URL ("/") that sends a simple response. Finally, we start the server and listen on the specified port number (`3000` in this example).

## Step 5: Start the Server

1. Save the changes to `server.js`.
2. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory if you are not already there.
3. Start the server by running the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see the message "Server is running on port 3000" printed in the console, indicating that the server has started successfully.

## Step 6: Test the Server

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. You should see the message "Hello, world!" displayed in the browser, indicating that the server is working correctly.

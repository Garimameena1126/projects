# Creating a Basic File Structure

In this task, we will create a basic file structure for your Order Tracking and Status Updates project. Having a well-organized file structure helps in better management of your project's codebase. We will create separate folders for the frontend and backend components. Follow the steps below to create the basic file structure.

## Step 1: Open your Code Editor

Open your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom. This is where you will create and manage your project files.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory you created earlier. This is the directory where you initialized the Git repository.

## Step 3: Create the Frontend Folder

Create a new folder called "frontend" to store all the frontend-related files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This folder will contain the user interface code.

1. In your code editor, right-click on the project directory.
2. Select the option to create a new folder.
3. Name the folder "frontend" and press Enter to create it.

Your project directory should now contain the "frontend" folder.

## Step 4: Create the Backend Folder

Similarly, create a new folder called "backend" to store all the backend-related files, such as server-side code, API endpoints, and database configuration.

1. Right-click on the project directory in your code editor.
2. Choose the option to create a new folder.
3. Name the folder "backend" and press Enter to create it.

Now, your project directory should include both the "frontend" and "backend" folders.

## Step 5: Verify the File Structure

To verify that the file structure has been created correctly, you can check the project directory in your code editor. It should display the "frontend" and "backend" folders as subdirectories of your project.

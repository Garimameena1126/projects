# Setting Up Project Directory and Version Control

In this guide, we will walk through the steps to set up a new project directory and initialize a version control system for our inventory management system.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- Git (version control system) installed ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

## Step 1: Create a New Project Directory

1. Open your preferred terminal or command prompt.
2. Choose a location on your file system where you want to create the project directory.
3. Navigate to that location using the `cd` command. For example, if you want to create the project directory in your "Documents" folder, you would run:
   ```bash
   cd Documents
   ```
4. Create a new directory for your project using the `mkdir` command followed by the desired project name. For example:
   ```bash
   mkdir inventory-management-system
   ```

## Step 2: Initialize Version Control with Git

1. Navigate into the project directory using the `cd` command. For example:
   ```bash
   cd inventory-management-system
   ```
2. Initialize a new Git repository by running the following command:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   This will create a hidden `.git` folder in your project directory, which tracks changes to your code.

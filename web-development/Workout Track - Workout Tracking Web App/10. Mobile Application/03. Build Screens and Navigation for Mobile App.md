
## Build Screens and Navigation for the Workout Tracking App

In this task, we will focus on building the screens and navigation for the workout tracking app using the chosen cross-platform mobile development framework. This will involve creating the necessary user interface screens and implementing navigation between them. Let's get started!

### Step 1: Set Up the Mobile Development Environment

Before we begin building the screens and navigation, make sure you have set up the mobile development environment and installed the required dependencies. Follow the framework-specific documentation to install the necessary tools and SDKs.

### Step 2: Create the App's Main Screen

The main screen serves as the entry point for the workout tracking app. It typically contains a logo, app title, and login/register options. Here's an example of how you can create the main screen using the chosen framework:

```javascript
// Import necessary components and libraries
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Image, Button } from 'react-native';

// Define the main screen component
const MainScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Image source={require('path/to/logo.png')} />
      <Text>Welcome to the Workout Tracking App!</Text>
      <Button title="Login" onPress={() => { /* Handle login button press */ }} />
      <Button title="Register" onPress={() => { /* Handle register button press */ }} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MainScreen;
```

In this example, we import necessary components such as `View`, `Text`, `Image`, and `Button` from the framework's library. We then define the `MainScreen` component that renders the logo, app title, and login/register buttons.

### Step 3: Create Additional Screens

Next, we'll create additional screens that are required for the workout tracking app, such as the login screen, registration screen, and workout log screen. Each screen should be implemented as a separate component. Here's an example of how to create the login screen:

```javascript
// Import necessary components and libraries
import React from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native';

// Define the login screen component
const LoginScreen = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('');

  const handleLogin = () => {
    // Perform login logic
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Email"
        value={email}
        onChangeText={setEmail}
      />
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Password"
        value={password}
        onChangeText={setPassword}
        secureTextEntry
      />
      <Button title="Login" onPress={handleLogin} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default LoginScreen;
```

Similarly, you can create the registration screen and other screens as per the app's requirements.

### Step 4: Implement Navigation

To enable navigation between screens, we need to set up a navigation system provided by the chosen framework. This allows users to move between different screens of the app. Here's an example of how to set up navigation using the framework's navigation library:

```javascript
// Import necessary components and libraries
import { createStackNavigator } from 'react-navigation-stack';
import { createAppContainer } from 'react-navigation';

// Import screen components
import MainScreen from './MainScreen';
import LoginScreen from './LoginScreen';

// Define the app's navigation stack
const AppNavigator = createStackNavigator(
  {
    Main: {
      screen: MainScreen,
    },
    Login: {
     

 screen: LoginScreen,
    },
  },
  {
    initialRouteName: 'Main',
  }
);

// Create the app container
const AppContainer = createAppContainer(AppNavigator);

export default AppContainer;
```

In this example, we import the necessary navigation components and the screen components we created earlier. We define a stack navigator (`createStackNavigator`) that maps each screen component to a specific route name. The `initialRouteName` specifies which screen should be displayed first when the app launches.

### Step 5: Test the App

Once you have implemented the screens and navigation, it's important to test the app on different devices and simulate various scenarios to ensure everything works as expected. Deploy the app to an emulator or a physical device and interact with the screens to verify the navigation flows correctly.

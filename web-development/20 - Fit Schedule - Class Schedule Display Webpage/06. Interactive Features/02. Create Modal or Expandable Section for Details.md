#### Task: Create a modal or expandable section that displays information such as class description, instructor bio, and any prerequisites.

1. In your HTML file (`index.html`), identify the area where you want to display the class details. This could be within the container element for the class schedule display section or any other suitable location.

2. Determine the HTML structure for the modal or expandable section. You can use a combination of HTML elements such as `<div>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, or any other suitable elements to organize and display the class details.

3. Add a trigger element that users can click on to open the modal or expandable section. This could be the class name or timing element from the class schedule display.

4. Assign an `id` to the trigger element to make it easier to associate with the corresponding class details.

5. Next, let's add some example class details within the modal or expandable section. Here's an example structure:

```html
<div id="class-details" style="display: none;">
  <h2>Class Title</h2>
  <p>Class Description: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
  <p>Instructor: John Doe</p>
  <p>Prerequisites: None</p>
</div>
```

Explanation:
- The `<div>` element serves as the container for the class details.
- The `id="class-details"` attribute is used to uniquely identify this element.
- The `style="display: none;"` attribute initially hides the class details, as we will use JavaScript to show and hide them later.
- Inside the `<div>`, we have example class details such as the class title, description, instructor, and prerequisites.

6. To handle the click event and toggle the visibility of the class details, we'll use JavaScript. Add the following JavaScript code within a `<script>` tag in your HTML file:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    var classDetails = document.getElementById("class-details");
    var triggerElement = document.getElementById("trigger-element");

    triggerElement.addEventListener("click", function() {
      if (classDetails.style.display === "none") {
        classDetails.style.display = "block";
      } else {
        classDetails.style.display = "none";
      }
    });
  });
</script>
```

Explanation:
- The `DOMContentLoaded` event ensures that the JavaScript code runs after the HTML document has been completely loaded.
- We obtain references to the class details element and the trigger element using their respective `id` attributes.
- We add a click event listener to the trigger element.
- Inside the event listener function, we check the current display state of the class details element using its `style.display` property.
- If the class details are hidden (`display === "none"`), we set the display property to `"block"` to make them visible. Otherwise, we hide them by setting the display property to `"none"`.

7. Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser. Clicking on the trigger element should now toggle the visibility of the class details, displaying them when clicked and hiding them when clicked again.

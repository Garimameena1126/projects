
## Create the Basic Structure of the Website

In this task, we will set up the basic structure of the website by creating the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This will serve as the foundation for our Fitness Goal Tracker project.

### Step 1: Set Up the Project Directory

1. Create a new directory for your project. You can name it "fitness-goal-tracker" or choose a name of your preference.
2. Open a code editor and navigate to the project directory.

### Step 2: Create the HTML File

1. Inside the project directory, create a new file called `index.html`.
2. Open `index.html` in your code editor.

### Step 3: Add the HTML Structure
Start by adding the basic HTML structure to your `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Fitness Goal Tracker</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<body>
  <header>
    <!-- Navigation bar will be added in a later step -->
  </header>

  <main>
    <!-- Content of the landing page will be added in a later step -->
  </main>

  <footer>
    <!-- Footer content will be added in a later step -->
  </footer>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

Let's go through the code you added:

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and version.
- The `<html>` element represents the root of an HTML document.
- The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document and external resources.
- Inside the `<head>` section, we set the character encoding, viewport configuration, and title of the page.
- The `<link>` element is used to link an external CSS file (`styles.css`).
- The `<body>` section contains the visible content of the webpage.
- Inside the `<body>` section, we have a `<header>` for the navigation bar, a `<main>` section for the main content, and a `<footer>` section for the footer content.
- Finally, we link an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) at the end of the `<body>` section.

### Step 4: Create the CSS File

1. Inside the project directory, create a new file called `styles.css`.
2. Open `styles.css` in your code editor.

### Step 5: Style the Basic Elements

Add the following CSS code to `styles.css` to style the basic elements of the website:

```css
/* Apply some basic styles to the body */
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

/* Style the header */
header {
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Style the main content */
main {
  padding: 20px;
}

/* Style the footer */
footer {
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

The CSS code above sets basic styles for the `body`, `header`, `main`, and `footer` elements.

### Step 6: Create the JavaScript File

1. Inside the project directory, create a new file called `script.js`.
2. Open `script.js` in your code editor.

### Step 7: Add JavaScript Functionality (Optional)

At this stage, since we're focusing on the basic structure of the website, there's no specific JavaScript functionality to add. However, you can include any additional JavaScript code related to the overall functionality of your Fitness Goal Tracker project.

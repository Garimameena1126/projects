In this guide, we will extend the recommendation system to provide real-time recommendations by incorporating user feedback and dynamically updating the recommendations based on user interactions. We will cover the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries and modules.
2. Load the preprocessed dataset.
3. Implement user feedback collection.
4. Update the recommendation system based on user feedback.
5. Generate real-time recommendations.

Let's begin!

## Step 1: Import necessary libraries and modules

Before we start implementing real-time recommendations, let's import the required libraries and modules. In this guide, we will be using Python and the following libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

## Step 2: Load the preprocessed dataset

To incorporate real-time recommendations, we need a preprocessed dataset that has already undergone the necessary preprocessing steps. Load the preprocessed dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Assuming you have a CSV file named `preprocessed_data.csv`, use the following code:

```python
data = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_data.csv')
```

## Step 3: Implement user feedback collection

To provide real-time recommendations, we need to collect user feedback on the recommendations they receive. User feedback can be in the form of explicit ratings (e.g., thumbs up or thumbs down) or implicit feedback (e.g., the time spent on a recommended destination). In this guide, let's assume we have a column named `user_rating` in our dataset to store the user feedback.

To collect user feedback, we can create a function that prompts the user to rate the recommended destinations. Here's an example:

```python
def collect_user_feedback(recommendations):
    for i, recommendation in enumerate(recommendations):
        print(f'Recommendation {i+1}: {recommendation}')
        rating = input('Rate this recommendation (1-5): ')
        # Store the user rating in the dataset
        data.loc[recommendation['destination_id'], 'user_rating'] = rating
```

## Step 4: Update the recommendation system based on user feedback

After collecting user feedback, we need to update the recommendation system based on the received ratings. One common approach is to incorporate the user ratings into the collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithms to improve the accuracy of the recommendations.

Let's assume you are using collaborative filtering. You can update the user-item matrix with the new ratings and recompute the similarity scores. Here's an example:

```python
def update_recommendation_system():
    # Update the user-item matrix with user ratings
    user_item_matrix = data.pivot(index='user_id', columns='destination_id', values='user_rating')
    
    # Recompute similarity scores using collaborative filtering algorithm
    # Implement the collaborative filtering algorithm of your choice here
    # Update the recommendation system with the new similarity scores
```

## Step 5: Generate real-time recommendations

Once the recommendation system is updated with the user feedback, we can generate real-time recommendations for the user. This can be done by applying the collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithm to the updated dataset.

Here's an example of generating real-time recommendations using collaborative filtering:

```python
def generate_real_time_recommendations(user_id):
    # Get the user's preferences from the dataset
    user_preferences = data.loc[data['user_id'] == user_id]
    
    # Implement collaborative filtering algorithm to generate recommendations
    # Consider user preferences and similarity scores
    # Return the top recommended destinations
    
    # Example: Return top 5 recommendations
    return recommendations[:5]
```

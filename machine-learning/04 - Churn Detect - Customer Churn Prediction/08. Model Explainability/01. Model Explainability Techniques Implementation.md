# Module 8: Model Explainability

## Task: Employing Model Explainability Techniques

In this task, we will explore techniques such as SHAP values, partial dependence plots, and LIME to provide explanations for individual predictions and enhance the interpretability of our machine learning model. These techniques help us understand the factors that contribute to the predictions made by our model, making it easier to gain insights and trust in the model's decisions.

We will cover the following steps in this guide:

1. Introduction to Model Explainability Techniques
2. Using SHAP Values
3. Generating Partial Dependence Plots
4. Applying LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)

Let's dive into each step in detail.

## 1. Introduction to Model Explainability Techniques

Model explainability techniques aim to uncover the factors that influence the predictions made by our machine learning model. They provide insights into the importance of different features or variables and help us understand how the model arrived at its decisions. This understanding is crucial for building trust in the model and making informed decisions based on its predictions.

In this guide, we will explore three popular model explainability techniques: SHAP values, partial dependence plots, and LIME.

## 2. Using SHAP Values

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. They are based on the concept of Shapley values from cooperative game theory. SHAP values assign each feature an importance value for a specific prediction, considering all possible feature combinations.

To use SHAP values, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install the Required Libraries

First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. In this guide, we will use the `shap` library, which provides an implementation of SHAP values. Install it using the following command:

```python
!pip install shap
```

### Step 2: Import the Required Libraries and Load the Model

Next, import the necessary libraries and load your trained machine learning model. Make sure you have already trained a model using the previous modules.

```python
import shap
import your_trained_model_module  # Import your trained model module

# Load your trained model
model = your_trained_model_module.load_model()
```

### Step 3: Prepare the Data and Generate SHAP Values

Prepare the data you want to explain by selecting a sample or specific instance from your dataset.

```python
import numpy as np

# Select a sample instance for explanation
sample = X_test.iloc[0]  # Replace with your own data instance

# Convert the sample into a format compatible with SHAP
sample_array = np.array([sample])  # Reshape as needed

# Generate SHAP values
explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
shap_values = explainer(sample_array)
```

### Step 4: Visualize the SHAP Values

Finally, visualize the SHAP values to interpret the importance of different features in the prediction.

```python
shap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])
```

This will display a waterfall plot showing the contribution of each feature to the final prediction. Positive values indicate features that increase the prediction, while negative values indicate features that decrease the prediction.

## 3. Generating Partial Dependence Plots

Partial dependence plots show how the predictions of a machine learning model change with variations in a specific feature, while keeping all other features constant. They help us understand the relationship between a particular feature and the predicted outcome.

To generate partial dependence plots, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install the Required Libraries

Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. In this guide, we will use the `

matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `sklearn` libraries. Install them using the following command:

```python
!pip install matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
```

### Step 2: Import the Required Libraries and Load the Model

Import the necessary libraries and load your trained model.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.inspection import plot_partial_dependence

# Load your trained model
model = your_trained_model_module.load_model()
```

### Step 3: Generate Partial Dependence Plots

Choose a feature for which you want to generate a partial dependence plot.

```python
# Select the feature index or name
feature_index = 0  # Replace with the desired feature index or name

# Generate partial dependence plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))
plot_partial_dependence(model, X_train, features=[feature_index], ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

This code will display a plot depicting how the model's predictions change as the selected feature varies while keeping other features constant.

## 4. Applying LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)

LIME is a model-agnostic technique that provides local explanations for individual predictions. It approximates the behavior of the underlying machine learning model locally and provides an interpretable explanation in terms of important features.

To apply LIME, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install the Required Libraries

Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. In this guide, we will use the `lime` library. Install it using the following command:

```python
!pip install lime
```

### Step 2: Import the Required Libraries and Load the Model

Import the necessary libraries and load your trained model.

```python
import lime
import lime.lime_tabular

# Load your trained model
model = your_trained_model_module.load_model()
```

### Step 3: Prepare the Data and Generate LIME Explanations

Prepare the data for explanation and generate LIME explanations for a specific instance.

```python
# Select a sample instance for explanation
sample = X_test.iloc[0]  # Replace with your own data instance

# Create a LIME explainer
explainer = lime.lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer(X_train.values, feature_names=X_train.columns, class_names=model.classes_)

# Generate LIME explanation
explanation = explainer.explain_instance(sample.values, model.predict_proba)
explanation.show_in_notebook(show_all=False)
```

This will display a summary of the important features and their contributions to the prediction for the selected instance.

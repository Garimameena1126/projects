#### Task: Store the user's authentication token securely in the browser's local storage or cookie

1. Assuming you have already implemented the user authentication system using a backend framework or service, and you have successfully obtained an authentication token upon successful login or registration, we will focus on storing this token securely in the browser.

2. In your frontend code, typically in the JavaScript file that handles user authentication-related functionality, add the following code snippet:

```javascript
// Assuming you have obtained the authentication token from the backend
const authToken = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN";

// Storing the token securely in the browser's local storage
localStorage.setItem("authToken", authToken);
```

Explanation:
- In the above code, we assume you have received the authentication token from the backend. Replace `"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"` with the actual token received.
- The `localStorage.setItem("authToken", authToken)` line stores the token in the browser's local storage.
- The `localStorage` object provides a simple way to store key-value pairs locally within the user's browser.

3. Alternatively, if you prefer to store the token in a cookie instead of local storage, you can use the following code snippet:

```javascript
// Assuming you have obtained the authentication token from the backend
const authToken = "YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN";

// Storing the token securely in a cookie
document.cookie = `authToken=${authToken}; secure; SameSite=Strict`;
```

Explanation:
- In the above code, replace `"YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"` with the actual token received.
- The `document.cookie` assignment sets a new cookie named "authToken" with the value of the authentication token.
- The `secure` attribute ensures that the cookie is only sent over encrypted HTTPS connections.
- The `SameSite=Strict` attribute restricts the cookie to be sent only in first-party context, improving security.

4. By storing the authentication token securely in either local storage or a cookie, you have now successfully implemented a way to persist the token across multiple browser sessions.

Remember to retrieve the token from either local storage or the cookie when making authenticated API requests and handle any expiration or invalidation logic as required by your backend authentication system.

# Creating Email Templates for Notifications

In this guide, we will focus on creating email templates for notifications such as booking updates or cancellations in your project. Email templates allow you to customize the content and design of the emails that will be sent to users. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Determine the Types of Notification Emails

Before we create the email templates, let's identify the types of notification emails you want to send. For example, you may want to create templates for booking updates, booking cancellations, payment reminders, or any other relevant notifications.

## Step 2: Design the Email Templates

In this step, we will design the email templates using HTML and CSS. These templates will serve as the base structure for your notification emails.

1. Open a new HTML file for each email template you want to create.

2. Write the HTML code to structure the email template. Include the necessary tags such as `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. You can also add a custom CSS style block within the `<head>` section or link an external CSS file.

3. Use HTML tags to create the desired layout and structure for your email template. Consider using tables, divs, headings, paragraphs, and other HTML elements to organize the content.

4. Add relevant placeholders or variables in the template that will be dynamically replaced with actual data when sending the emails. These placeholders will allow you to personalize the content for each recipient.

   Here's an example of an email template for a booking update:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>Booking Update</title>
       <style>
         /* Add your CSS styles here */
       </style>
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Booking Update</h1>
       <p>Dear {{username}},</p>
       <p>We would like to inform you that there has been an update to your booking.</p>
       <p>New Check-in Date: {{checkInDate}}</p>
       <p>New Check-out Date: {{checkOutDate}}</p>
       <p>If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
       <p>Best regards,</p>
       <p>The Booking Team</p>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   Customize the content and placeholders based on the specific type of email template you are creating.

## Step 3: Save the Email Templates

Save each email template as an HTML file in your project's directory. Create a separate file for each type of email template you designed.

For example:
- `booking_update.html`
- `booking_cancellation.html`
- `payment_reminder.html`

## Step 4: Integrate Email Templates with Email Service

Now that we have created the email templates, we need to integrate them with the email service to send personalized notification emails.

1. Modify the email service code to read the HTML templates and replace the placeholders with actual data.

2. Load the HTML template file and replace the placeholders with the corresponding values. You can use a templating engine or string replacement techniques to achieve this.

   Here's an example in JavaScript:

   ```javascript
   function sendNotificationEmail(recipientEmail, templatePath, data) {
     const fs = require('fs');
     const template = fs.readFileSync(templatePath, 'utf-8');

     // Perform dynamic rendering of the template using a templating engine or string replacement
     const renderedTemplate = template
       .replace('{{username}}', data.username)
       .replace('{{checkInDate}}', data.checkInDate)
       .replace('{{checkOutDate}}', data.checkOutDate);

     // Use the rendered template to send the

 email via the email delivery service
     // ...
   }
   ```

3. Call the `sendNotificationEmail` function with the recipient's email address, the path to the appropriate email template file, and the data specific to the notification.

   ```javascript
   const recipientEmail = 'user@example.com';
   const templatePath = 'booking_update.html';
   const data = {
     username: 'John Doe',
     checkInDate: '2023-06-25',
     checkOutDate: '2023-06-30',
   };

   sendNotificationEmail(recipientEmail, templatePath, data);
   ```

   Customize the data object and template path according to the specific notification email you want to send.

# Hash and Store User Passwords

In this guide, we will learn how to securely hash and store user passwords in a web application for user authentication and authorization. Hashing passwords is an important security measure to protect user information in case of a data breach. We will use a popular hashing algorithm called bcrypt to securely store passwords.

## Step 1: Set Up Dependencies

Before we can hash and store user passwords, we need to set up the necessary dependencies in our web application. Make sure you have a working web application with user authentication and authorization features implemented.

1. Open your project in your preferred code editor.

2. Make sure you have bcrypt installed as a dependency. You can install it using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```
   npm install bcrypt
   ```

   This will add the bcrypt package to your project's dependencies.

## Step 2: Hash User Passwords during Registration

When a user registers in your web application, you should hash their password before storing it in the database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, the passwords will be difficult to retrieve.

1. In your registration route or controller, import the bcrypt package:

   ```javascript
   const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
   ```

2. Retrieve the user's password from the registration form or request body.

3. Hash the password using the `bcrypt.hash()` function. This function takes the password and a salt round as parameters. The salt round determines the complexity and processing time of the hash. A higher value provides better security but takes longer to compute.

   ```javascript
   const saltRounds = 10;
   bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
     // Store the hashed password in the database
   });
   ```

4. Store the hashed password in your database, associating it with the user's account.

## Step 3: Validate User Passwords during Login

When a user tries to log in, you need to compare their entered password with the stored hashed password to authenticate them.

1. In your login route or controller, retrieve the user's entered password and username from the login form or request body.

2. Retrieve the corresponding hashed password from the database based on the provided username.

3. Use the `bcrypt.compare()` function to compare the entered password with the stored hashed password. This function returns a boolean value indicating whether the passwords match.

   ```javascript
   bcrypt.compare(enteredPassword, storedHashedPassword, function(err, result) {
     if (result) {
       // Passwords match, grant access to the user
     } else {
       // Passwords do not match, deny access
     }
   });
   ```

   Note: The `bcrypt.compare()` function handles the necessary steps to compare the passwords securely, including checking the salt used in the original hashing.

4. Based on the result of the comparison, you can proceed with granting or denying access to the user.

## Step 4: Update Passwords (Optional)

In some cases, users may want to update their passwords. To ensure security, you should follow a similar process to hash and store the updated password.

1. Implement a password update form or endpoint where users can provide their current password and the new password.

2. Retrieve the user's current password and new password from the form or request body.

3. Retrieve the user's stored hashed password from the database.

4. Use the `bcrypt.compare()` function to compare the current password entered by the user with the stored hashed password.

5. If the comparison is successful, proceed to hash the new password using the steps described in Step 2. Store the updated hashed password in the database.

6. If the comparison fails, notify the user that their current password is incorrect.
6. If the comparison fails, notify the user that their current password is incorrect.

# Beginner's Guide: Setting up a Server using Express.js

In this guide, we will focus on setting up a server for your reviews and ratings system using Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js. We will provide step-by-step instructions and code examples to help beginners set up the server.

## Step 1: Initialize the Project

Before setting up the server, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).

Once Node.js is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

To initialize a new Node.js project, run the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command creates a new `package.json` file in your project directory, which will track the dependencies and scripts for your project.

## Step 2: Install Express.js

To install Express.js and its dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install express
```

This command installs Express.js and saves it as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

## Step 3: Create the Server File

In your project directory, create a new file called `server.js` (or any other name of your choice) using a text editor.

Open the `server.js` file and add the following code to set up a basic Express.js server:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define routes and middleware here

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In this code, we import the `express` module and create an instance of the Express.js application (`app`). We also define a port number (`3000` in this example) on which the server will listen for incoming requests.

## Step 4: Define Routes and Middleware

Now, let's define routes and middleware to handle the server's functionality.

### Example: Handling a GET request

To handle a basic GET request and send a response, add the following code to the `server.js` file:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});
```

In this example, we define a route using the `app.get()` method. When a GET request is made to the root URL (`'/'`), the callback function is executed. Inside the callback function, we send the response `'Hello, world!'` using the `res.send()` method.

### Example: Serving Static Files

To serve static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from a specific directory, add the following code:

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

Assuming you have a directory named `public` in your project directory, this code enables Express.js to serve static files from that directory. Make sure to create the `public` directory and place your static files inside it.

## Step 5: Start the Server

To start the server, go to your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the message "Server listening at http://localhost:3000" in your terminal.

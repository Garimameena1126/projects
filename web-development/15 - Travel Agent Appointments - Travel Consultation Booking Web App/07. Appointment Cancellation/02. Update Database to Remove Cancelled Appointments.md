
**Task: Remove the corresponding appointment from the MongoDB database**

1. **Connect to the MongoDB database**: In your server-side code (e.g., using Node.js), establish a connection to your MongoDB database. This will allow you to interact with the database and perform operations like removing appointments. Here's an example of connecting to MongoDB using the official MongoDB Node.js driver:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// Connection URI and database name
const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
const dbName = 'your_database_name';

// Create a new MongoClient
const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true });

// Connect to the MongoDB server
client.connect((err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', err);
    return;
  }

  console.log('Connected to MongoDB');

  // Access the database
  const db = client.db(dbName);

  // Perform further operations inside this connection
});
```

Make sure to replace `'your_database_name'` with the actual name of your database.

2. **Remove the appointment**: Inside the MongoDB connection, write the code to remove the appointment from the database. This step assumes that you have the appointment ID available.

```javascript
// Assuming you have the appointment ID available
const appointmentId = 'your_appointment_id';

// Access the appointments collection
const collection = db.collection('appointments');

// Remove the appointment from the collection
collection.deleteOne({ _id: appointmentId }, (err, result) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error removing appointment:', err);
    return;
  }

  console.log('Appointment removed successfully');
});

// Close the MongoDB connection after completing the operation
client.close();
```

In this example, we assume that your appointments are stored in a collection named `'appointments'`. Adjust the collection name to match your database structure.

3. **Test the code**: Start your server or run the script containing the MongoDB removal code. Ensure that the MongoDB connection is established, and the appointment removal logic executes without errors. Monitor the console for any error messages or success messages.

4. **Verify appointment removal**: After running the code, check your MongoDB database to confirm that the appointment with the specified ID has been successfully removed.

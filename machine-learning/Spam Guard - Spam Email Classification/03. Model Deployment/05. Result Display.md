In this task, we will focus on creating a basic web interface that allows users to input an email and displays the prediction result (spam or not spam) based on the trained model. We will also preprocess the user input using the same cleaning and formatting techniques used during training.

Let's break down the steps required to accomplish this task:

## Step 1: Set up the Web Framework

To create the web interface, we'll use the Flask framework, which is a lightweight and beginner-friendly web framework for Python. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Install Flask by running the following command in your command line or terminal:

```bash
pip install flask
```

2. Create a new Python file called `app.py` and import the necessary modules:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
```

3. Initialize the Flask application:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

## Step 2: Create the Web Form

In this step, we'll define the web form where users can input their email. We'll use HTML templates to design the form. Here's an example:

1. Create a new folder called `templates` in the project directory.

2. Inside the `templates` folder, create a new HTML file called `index.html` and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Email Spam Classification</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Email Spam Classification</h1>
    <form action="/" method="POST">
        <label for="email">Enter an email:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="email" name="email" required><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 3: Preprocess User Input

To preprocess the user input, we'll apply the same cleaning and formatting techniques that were used during training. Here's an example of how you can preprocess the user input using Python:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
import re
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

# Download stopwords corpus (run only once)
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

2. Define a function for preprocessing the text:

```python
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Remove unnecessary characters
    text = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text)

    # Convert text to lowercase
    text = text.lower()

    # Remove stop words
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    words = text.split()
    words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]

    # Perform stemming
    stemmer = PorterStemmer()
    words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in words]

    # Join the processed words back into a single string
    processed_text = ' '.join(words)

    return processed_text
```

3. Use the `preprocess_text` function to preprocess the user input in the Flask route handler:

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def classify_email():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        email = request.form['email']
        processed_email = preprocess_text(email)
        # ...
```

## Step 4: Load the Trained Model

Before we can make predictions, we need to load the trained machine learning model. Assuming you have saved the model as a file (e.g., `model.pkl`), you can load it using the following code:

```python
import joblib

# Load the

 trained model
model = joblib.load('model.pkl')
```

Make sure to place this code in your Flask application file (`app.py`).

## Step 5: Make Predictions and Display the Result

Finally, we'll make predictions using the loaded model and display the result to the user. Here's an example:

1. Modify the Flask route handler to include the prediction logic:

```python
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def classify_email():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        email = request.form['email']
        processed_email = preprocess_text(email)
        prediction = model.predict([processed_email])[0]
        result = 'Spam' if prediction == 1 else 'Not Spam'
        return render_template('result.html', result=result)
    return render_template('index.html')
```

2. Create a new HTML file called `result.html` inside the `templates` folder, and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Email Spam Classification</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Email Spam Classification</h1>
    <h2>Result:</h2>
    <p>{{ result }}</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 6: Run the Application

To run the application, use the following command in your command line or terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the web interface. You should be able to enter an email and see the prediction result.

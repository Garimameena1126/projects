To capture lead information effectively, you need to add appropriate form fields and buttons to your lead management system. Follow these steps to accomplish this task:

#### Step 1: Open the HTML File

Ensure that you have already created the HTML file for your lead management system, as described in the previous tasks. Open the HTML file in your preferred text editor.

#### Step 2: Identify the Form Section

Within the main content area of your HTML file, identify the section where you want to place the lead capture form. This section should have an appropriate HTML tag such as `<form>` to encapsulate the form elements.

```html
<main class="content">
  <form>
    <!-- Form elements will be added here -->
  </form>
</main>
```

#### Step 3: Add Input Fields

Inside the `<form>` element, add the necessary input fields to capture lead information. Use the `<input>` tag with different `type` attributes to define various types of fields such as text, email, and phone number.

For example, to add a field for capturing the lead's name:

```html
<input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name">
```

Similarly, you can add fields for capturing email and phone number:

```html
<input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email">
<input type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Phone number">
```

Feel free to include additional fields based on the information you want to collect from the leads.

#### Step 4: Add Buttons

Next, add buttons to submit the form and perform other actions. Use the `<button>` tag to create buttons with appropriate labels.

For example, to add a submit button:

```html
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

You can also include other buttons for additional actions, such as a reset button to clear the form:

```html
<button type="reset">Reset</button>
```

#### Step 5: Include Labels and Styling

To improve usability and accessibility, it's important to include labels for each form field. Use the `<label>` tag and the `for` attribute to associate labels with their corresponding input fields.

For example, to add a label for the name field:

```html
<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Name">
```

Additionally, you can apply CSS styling to the form fields and buttons to enhance the visual appearance and make them consistent with your overall design.

#### Step 6: Save and Preview the Page

Save your HTML file after adding the form fields and buttons. Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the lead capture form with the added elements.

#### Step 7: Validate and Process the Form Data

To make the form functional, you'll need to handle the form submission and process the captured lead information. This typically involves using a server-side programming language like PHP or JavaScript.

Ensure that you have the necessary server-side scripts in place to handle the form data. Validate the input fields to ensure data integrity and security.

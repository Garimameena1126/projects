In this task, we will learn how to implement image optimization techniques to improve the page load times of your website. We will focus on two common techniques: lazy loading and using responsive images.

### Step 1: Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a technique where images are loaded only when they are needed, rather than loading all the images at once. This helps reduce the initial page load time and improves the overall performance.

1. Identify the images on your website that you want to lazy load.
2. Install a lazy loading library or plugin.
   - Popular options include lazysizes, Lozad.js, and Intersection Observer API.
   - For example, let's use lazysizes library.
3. Include the library in your project.
   - Download the lazysizes library or include it via a content delivery network (CDN).
   - Add the script tag to your HTML file:
     ```html
     <script src="path/to/lazysizes.min.js"></script>
     ```
4. Add the `lazyload` class to the images you want to lazy load.
   - Modify your `<img>` tags as follows:
     ```html
     <img class="lazyload" data-src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Image Description">
     ```
5. Initialize the lazy loading library.
   - Add the following script to your HTML file, typically at the end of the body tag:
     ```html
     <script>
       document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
         lazyload();
       });
     </script>
     ```

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented lazy loading for your images. Now, the images will load only when they are in the viewport, improving the initial page load time.

### Step 2: Responsive Images

Responsive images ensure that the appropriate image size is served based on the device's screen size. This reduces unnecessary bandwidth usage and improves page load times for different devices.

1. Identify the images on your website that need to be responsive.
2. Use responsive image techniques in your HTML markup.
   - Modify your `<img>` tags as follows:
     ```html
     <img src="path/to/image.jpg" srcset="path/to/image-800.jpg 800w, path/to/image-1200.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw" alt="Image Description">
     ```
   - In the `srcset` attribute, provide multiple image sources with their respective widths. This allows the browser to choose the most appropriate image based on the device's screen size.
   - In the `sizes` attribute, define the conditions for which image size to choose. The example above uses `(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw`, which means that for screens up to 600 pixels wide, the image will take 100% of the viewport width; otherwise, it will take 50% of the viewport width.
   - Provide an appropriate `alt` attribute for accessibility.
3. Test and verify the responsive images.
   - Open your website in different devices or use browser developer tools to simulate different screen sizes.
   - Verify that the appropriate image sizes are being loaded based on the screen size.

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented responsive images on your website. Now, the images will be served in appropriate sizes based on the device's screen, reducing bandwidth usage and improving page load times.

# Setting Up the Necessary JavaScript Libraries or Frameworks

In this task, we will set up the necessary JavaScript libraries or frameworks for implementing the frontend functionality of the Order Tracking and Status Updates feature. Depending on your preference and familiarity, you can choose to use popular JavaScript libraries/frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. Follow the steps below to set up React as an example.

## Step 1: Install Node.js

Before we start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which we will use to install and manage dependencies.

To check if Node.js is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```shell
node -v
```

If Node.js is not installed, visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the latest version suitable for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided.

## Step 2: Create a New React Project

Now, let's create a new React project using Create React App, a popular toolchain for creating React applications.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then, run the following command:

```shell
npx create-react-app order-tracking-app
```

This command creates a new directory named `order-tracking-app` and sets up a new React project inside it.

## Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory by running the following command:

```shell
cd order-tracking-app
```

Now, you are inside the project directory.

## Step 4: Start the Development Server

To start the development server and see your React application in action, run the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

This command starts the development server and opens your application in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You will be able to see the default React application template.

## Step 5: Clean Up the Default Files

By default, Create React App generates some files and folders that we won't be needing for this project. We can remove them to keep our project clean and organized.

Delete the following files from the project directory:

- `src/App.css`
- `src/App.test.js`
- `src/index.css`
- `src/logo.svg`
- `public/favicon.ico`
- `public/logo192.png`
- `public/logo512.png`
- `public/manifest.json`
- `public/robots.txt`

Also, remove the corresponding imports and references in the `src/App.js` file.

## Step 6: Install Additional Dependencies

Now, let's install any additional dependencies that we may need for the project. For example, if you want to use Bootstrap for styling, you can install it by running the following command:

```shell
npm install bootstrap
```

This installs the Bootstrap library and adds it to your project's dependencies.

## Step 7: Verify Setup

At this point, you have successfully set up a new React project and installed any additional dependencies you need. You can verify the setup by making changes to the default React application template or creating new components.

Open the `src/App.js` file and modify its contents to reflect your application's structure and requirements. Add any necessary components, styles, or logic to implement the desired functionality.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Add your components and content here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Step 8: Test the Changes

Save the modifications to the `src/App.js` file, and the development server will automatically update the application in the browser. Verify that your changes are reflected correctly.

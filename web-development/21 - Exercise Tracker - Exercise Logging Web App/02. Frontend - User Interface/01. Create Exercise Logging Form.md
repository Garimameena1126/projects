# Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a Form for Logging Exercise Sessions

In this task, we will create a form for users to log their exercise sessions in our exercise logging tool. The form will include input fields for exercise name, sets, and reps, allowing users to enter the details of their workouts.

## Prerequisites

- HTML and CSS knowledge
- Code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed

## Steps

1. **Open Code Editor**

   Launch your preferred code editor or IDE.

2. **Open the HTML File**

   Open the `index.html` file that you created earlier in your code editor.

3. **Create a Form Element**

   Inside the `<main>` section of the HTML file, create a `<form>` element to encapsulate the exercise logging form. Use the following code:

   ```html
   <form>
       <!-- Form content goes here -->
   </form>
   ```

   The `<form>` element will contain the input fields and submit button for logging exercise sessions.

4. **Add Input Fields**

   Inside the `<form>` element, add the following code to create input fields for exercise name, sets, and reps:

   ```html
   <form>
       <div>
           <label for="exercise-name">Exercise Name:</label>
           <input type="text" id="exercise-name" name="exercise-name" required>
       </div>
       <div>
           <label for="sets">Sets:</label>
           <input type="number" id="sets" name="sets" required>
       </div>
       <div>
           <label for="reps">Reps:</label>
           <input type="number" id="reps" name="reps" required>
       </div>
       <button type="submit">Log Exercise</button>
   </form>
   ```

   This code creates three input fields using the `<input>` element. The `id` attributes provide unique identifiers for each input field, while the `name` attributes associate each input with a specific form field. The `required` attribute ensures that all fields must be filled in before the form can be submitted.

5. **Style the Form**

   Open the `styles.css` file and add the following CSS code to style the exercise logging form:

   ```css
   /* styles.css */
   
   /* Style the form container */
   form {
       margin-top: 20px;
   }
   
   /* Style form inputs and labels */
   form div {
       margin-bottom: 10px;
   }
   
   label {
       display: inline-block;
       width: 100px;
   }
   
   input {
       width: 200px;
       padding: 5px;
   }
   
   button {
       margin-top: 10px;
       padding: 8px 12px;
       background-color: #4CAF50;
       color: white;
       border: none;
       border-radius: 4px;
       cursor: pointer;
   }
   
   button:hover {
       background-color: #45a049;
   }
   ```

   This CSS code applies styles to the form container, input fields, labels, and the submit button. You can customize the styles to match the overall design of your application.

6. **Preview the Form**

   Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see a preview of the exercise logging form. You should see the input fields for exercise name, sets, and reps, along with a submit button.

7. **Form Submission (Optional)**

   To handle the form submission and perform further actions, you can use JavaScript. However, that falls outside the scope of this specific task. You can explore handling form submission in a separate guide or tutorial.

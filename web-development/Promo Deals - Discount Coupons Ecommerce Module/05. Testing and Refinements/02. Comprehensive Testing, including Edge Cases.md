In this guide, we will perform thorough testing, including edge cases, to ensure the robustness and reliability of the system.

### Step 1: Identify Test Scenarios and Edge Cases

1. Identify the different test scenarios and edge cases that should be covered in the testing process. These may include boundary values, unexpected inputs, and exceptional situations.
2. Consider both valid and invalid inputs for various functionalities.
3. Document the identified test scenarios and edge cases for reference.

### Step 2: Write Test Cases

1. Create a new test file or class specifically for testing the system's functionalities.
2. Write individual test cases for each identified scenario and edge case.
3. Each test case should consist of inputs, expected outputs, and any necessary setup or teardown steps.

```javascript
// Example test file for system testing
import { Cart } from './cart';
import { Coupon } from './coupon';
import { Promotion } from './promotion';

describe('System Testing', () => {
  let cart;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Set up the initial state for each test case
    cart = new Cart();
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Clean up any resources after each test case
  });

  test('Adding items to the cart should reflect the correct total quantity and amount', () => {
    cart.addItem('Item 1', 10);
    cart.addItem('Item 2', 5);

    expect(cart.getTotalQuantity()).toBe(15);
    expect(cart.getTotalAmount()).toBe(15); // Assuming each item costs 1 unit

    cart.addItem('Item 3', 3);

    expect(cart.getTotalQuantity()).toBe(18);
    expect(cart.getTotalAmount()).toBe(18); // Assuming each item costs 1 unit
  });

  test('Applying a valid coupon should reflect the correct discount in the cart', () => {
    const coupon = new Coupon('SUMMER20');
    cart.applyCoupon(coupon);

    // Add items to the cart
    cart.addItem('Item 1', 10);
    cart.addItem('Item 2', 5);

    expect(cart.getDiscountedAmount()).toBe(15); // Assuming each item costs 1 unit

    cart.addItem('Item 3', 3);

    expect(cart.getDiscountedAmount()).toBe(18); // Assuming each item costs 1 unit
  });

  // Add more test cases for other functionalities and edge cases
});
```

### Step 3: Execute the Tests

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Execute the command to run the tests using the chosen testing framework.

```shell
$ npm test  # for Jest (JavaScript)
$ pytest   # for PyTest (Python)
$ mvn test # for JUnit (Java)
```

4. The testing framework will execute the defined test cases and display the results.

### Step 4: Analyze Test Results and Fix Issues

1. Inspect the test results to determine if all test cases passed successfully.
2. If any test cases failed, investigate the cause of the failure.
3. Modify the code implementation as necessary to fix any issues or bugs identified during testing.
4. Re-run the tests to verify that the fixes have resolved the problems.

### Step 5: Repeat Testing for Regression

1. After fixing any identified issues, rerun the tests to ensure that the changes did not introduce new problems (regressions).
2. Execute the tests regularly during the development process to maintain the reliability of the system.

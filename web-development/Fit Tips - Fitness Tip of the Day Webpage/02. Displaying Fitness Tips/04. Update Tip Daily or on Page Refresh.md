## Step-by-Step Guide: Ensuring the Tip Changes Daily or Upon Page Refresh

In this guide, we will focus on ensuring that the fitness tip displayed on the website's content section changes either daily or upon page refresh. We will accomplish this by utilizing JavaScript to select a random tip from a collection and updating the content dynamically. Let's get started!

### Step 1: Create an Array of Fitness Tips

1. Open the `script.js` file in a text editor.

   ```bash
   code script.js
   ```

2. Declare an array variable to store the collection of fitness tips.

   ```javascript
   // script.js

   const fitnessTips = [
       "Drink plenty of water throughout the day.",
       "Incorporate strength training exercises into your routine.",
       "Get at least 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night.",
       // Add more fitness tips as desired
   ];
   ```

   Here, we have provided three example fitness tips. You can add more tips to the array by following the same format.

### Step 2: Implement a Function to Select a Random Tip

1. Below the array declaration, add a function that selects a random fitness tip from the collection.

   ```javascript
   // script.js

   function getRandomFitnessTip() {
       const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * fitnessTips.length);
       return fitnessTips[randomIndex];
   }
   ```

   The `getRandomFitnessTip()` function uses the `Math.random()` method to generate a random index within the range of the fitnessTips array. It then returns the fitness tip at the randomly generated index.

### Step 3: Update the Website's Content with the Selected Tip

1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.

   ```bash
   code index.html
   ```

2. Locate the section of the HTML file where you want to display the fitness tip.

   ```html
   <!-- index.html -->

   <body>
       <!-- Content goes here -->
       <div id="fitnessTip"></div>
   </body>
   ```

   In this example, we have added a `<div>` element with the ID "fitnessTip" to represent the section where the tip will be displayed.

3. Insert the following script just before the closing `</body>` tag to update the content dynamically.

   ```html
   <!-- index.html -->

   <body>
       <!-- Content goes here -->
       <div id="fitnessTip"></div>

       <script src="script.js"></script>
       <script>
           const tipElement = document.getElementById('fitnessTip');
           const fitnessTip = getRandomFitnessTip();
           tipElement.innerText = fitnessTip;
       </script>
   </body>
   ```

   The script retrieves the element with the ID "fitnessTip" using `document.getElementById()`. It then sets the `innerText` property of the element to the randomly selected fitness tip obtained from the `getRandomFitnessTip()` function.

### Step 4: Test the Tip Changing Functionality

1. Save the changes made to the `script.js` and `index.html` files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser by double-clicking on it.

   The web page should now display a randomly selected fitness tip within the designated section.

3. Refresh the page or revisit it the next day to observe the tip changing dynamically.

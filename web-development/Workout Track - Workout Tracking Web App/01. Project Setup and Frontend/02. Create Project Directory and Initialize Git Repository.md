# Create a New Project Directory and Initialize Git Repository

In this task, we will create a new project directory for our web development project and navigate to it using the command line interface (CLI). The project directory will serve as the main folder where we will organize our project files and assets. We will also initialize the Git repository. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Choose a Location for Your Project Directory

First, we need to decide where we want to create our project directory. Choose a suitable location on your computer where you would like to store your project files.

For example, let's say we want to create our project directory on the desktop.

## Step 2: Open the Command Line Interface (CLI)

To create the project directory and navigate to it, we will use the command line interface (CLI) or terminal. The CLI allows us to interact with our computer through text-based commands.

Follow these steps to open the CLI:

1. Windows: Press the **Windows key** on your keyboard and search for **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**. Click on the corresponding application to open it.

   macOS: Press **Command + Space** on your keyboard to open **Spotlight Search**. Type **Terminal** and press **Enter** to open it.

2. The CLI will open in a new window.

## Step 3: Create the Project Directory

In the CLI, we will create the project directory by using the `mkdir` command. This command allows us to make a new directory.

Follow these steps to create the project directory:

1. In the CLI, navigate to the location you chose in step 1. For example, if you want to create the project directory on the desktop, use the following command:

   ```bash
   cd Desktop
   ```

   This command changes the current directory to the desktop.

2. Once you are in the desired location, execute the following command to create a new project directory. Replace `project-directory` with your preferred name for the directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir project-directory
   ```

   For example, if you want to name your project directory "my-project," the command would be:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-project
   ```

   This command creates a new directory with the specified name.

## Step 4: Navigate to the Project Directory

After creating the project directory, we need to navigate to it using the `cd` command. This command allows us to change the current directory to the specified directory.

Follow these steps to navigate to the project directory:

1. In the CLI, execute the following command to change the current directory to the newly created project directory. Replace `project-directory` with the name you chose in step 3:

   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   ```

   For example, if your project directory is named "my-project," the command would be:

   ```bash
   cd my-project
   ```

   This command changes the current directory to the project directory you created.

2. Verify that you are now inside the project directory by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

   This command displays the current working directory. The output should show the path to your project directory.

## Step 5: Initialize a New Git Repository

To track changes and collaborate effectively, we will initialize a new Git repository for your project. Git is a widely used version control system that helps manage code revisions. Follow these steps to initialize a new Git repository:

1. Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code (if not already open) by following the instructions mentioned in Step 3.

2. In the terminal, navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command. For example, if your project directory is located on the desktop, you can use the command `cd Desktop/project-directory`.

3. Once you are inside the project directory, execute the following command to initialize a new Git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. Git will create a new repository in your project directory, enabling version control for your files.

5. Verify that the repository was successfully initialized by running the command:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   This command should display a message indicating that there are no commits yet.

To store communication history for leads in a separate table, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Design the Communication History Table

Design the structure of the communication history table. Determine the columns you need to store relevant information, such as lead ID, communication date and time, communication type, message content, etc.

Here's an example of how the communication history table schema might look:

| Column Name   | Data Type    | Description                                      |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| id            | INTEGER      | Unique identifier for each communication entry    |
| lead_id       | INTEGER      | Foreign key referencing the lead table            |
| date_time     | DATETIME     | Date and time of the communication                |
| type          | VARCHAR(50)  | Type of communication (e.g., call, email, meeting) |
| content       | TEXT         | Content of the communication                       |

## Step 2: Create the Communication History Table in the Database

Using the appropriate database management tool (e.g., SQL command-line interface, database GUI tool, ORM), execute the necessary SQL command to create the communication history table in your database.

Here's an example of how the SQL command might look:

```sql
CREATE TABLE communication_history (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  lead_id INTEGER,
  date_time DATETIME,
  type VARCHAR(50),
  content TEXT
);
```

Make sure to adjust the SQL statement based on your database system and any additional requirements.

## Step 3: Update the Lead Table with Foreign Key Relationship

Since the communication history table is related to the lead table, you'll need to establish a foreign key relationship between them. This ensures that each communication history entry is associated with the corresponding lead.

If the lead table already exists, add a foreign key column to reference the communication history table. Alternatively, if you are creating the lead table from scratch, include the necessary foreign key column.

Here's an example of how the foreign key column might be added to the lead table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE leads
ADD COLUMN communication_history_id INTEGER,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (communication_history_id) REFERENCES communication_history(id);
```

Again, adjust the SQL statement according to your specific database system and table structure.

## Step 4: Update Application Code to Insert Communication History

Update your application code to include the necessary logic for inserting communication history entries into the new table.

When a communication occurs for a lead, capture the relevant information (e.g., lead ID, date and time, communication type, content) and insert a new row into the communication history table.

Here's an example of how the code might look in a server-side language like Python using SQL queries:

```python
# Example Python code for inserting communication history
import sqlite3

def insert_communication_history(lead_id, date_time, communication_type, content):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    query = '''
        INSERT INTO communication_history (lead_id, date_time, type, content)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
    '''
    cursor.execute(query, (lead_id, date_time, communication_type, content))
    conn.commit()

    conn.close()
```

Adjust the code based on your chosen programming language, database system, and any specific frameworks or libraries you're using.

## Step 5: Test the Communication History Functionality

To ensure that the communication history functionality works as intended, test it thoroughly. Perform various communication actions for leads and verify that the corresponding entries are inserted into the communication history table.

You can also test the foreign key relationship by retrieving communication history entries for a specific lead.

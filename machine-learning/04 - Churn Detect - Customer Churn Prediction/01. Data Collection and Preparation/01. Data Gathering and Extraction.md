Task: Gather historical customer data

Step 1: Identify the data sources
- Determine the sources from which you can gather historical customer data. This may include databases, log files, APIs, or any other relevant data repositories.

Step 2: Understand the data requirements
- Define the specific data requirements for your project. Identify the relevant features and variables that will be useful for predicting customer churn. These may include customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, location), usage patterns (e.g., frequency of interactions, duration of sessions), and interactions with the platform (e.g., purchases, clicks, support tickets).

Step 3: Obtain access to the data
- Obtain necessary permissions and access rights to retrieve the historical customer data from the e-commerce SAAS company. If needed, consult with the relevant stakeholders or data custodians to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

Step 4: Retrieve the data
- Write code or use appropriate tools to retrieve the historical customer data from the identified sources. Depending on the data source, you may need to use SQL queries, API calls, or file parsing techniques to extract the required information.

Step 5: Load the data into a suitable format
- Once the data is retrieved, load it into a suitable format for further analysis. Common formats include CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, Excel spreadsheets, or structured data formats like Parquet or JSON.

Step 6: Inspect the data
- Begin exploring the data to gain a preliminary understanding of its structure and contents. Use code snippets to inspect the data and perform basic operations such as displaying the first few rows, checking the column names, and understanding the data types.

Example code (Python/pandas):
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data into a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(data.head())
```

Step 7: Handle missing values
- Identify any missing values in the dataset and decide how to handle them. Depending on the extent of missing data, you can either drop the rows or columns with missing values or impute them using techniques such as mean, median, or regression-based imputation.

Example code (Python/pandas):
```python
# Check for missing values in the dataset
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Remove rows with missing values
data = data.dropna()

# Alternatively, impute missing values using mean or median
data['age'].fillna(data['age'].mean(), inplace=True)
```

Step 8: Remove duplicates
- Check for duplicate records in the dataset and remove them if necessary. Duplicates can skew the analysis and model training process by introducing redundancy.

Example code (Python/pandas):
```python
# Check for duplicate records
print(data.duplicated().sum())

# Remove duplicate records
data = data.drop_duplicates()
```

Step 9: Address outliers (if necessary)
- Identify any outliers in the dataset that may significantly impact the analysis or model performance. Depending on the specific context, outliers can be handled by either removing them, transforming them, or treating them as separate categories.

Example code (Python/pandas):
```python
# Visualize the distribution of a numerical variable (e.g., age)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.boxplot(data['age'])
plt.show()

# Identify and remove outliers based on a threshold (e.g., 3 standard deviations)
data = data[(data['age'] > mean - 3 * std) &

 (data['age'] < mean + 3 * std)]
```

Step 10: Explore the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution of different variables. This may involve visualizations, summary statistics, or hypothesis testing to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.

Example code (Python/pandas):
```python
# Generate summary statistics for numerical variables
print(data.describe())

# Visualize the distribution of a categorical variable (e.g., gender)
data['gender'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()

# Calculate correlations between variables
correlation_matrix = data.corr()
print(correlation_matrix)
```

## Set Up a Basic Folder Structure for the Project

In this guide, we will set up a basic folder structure for the project management app. This structure will help organize the frontend and backend code separately, making it easier to manage and maintain.

### Step 1: Open the Project Folder

Open the project folder "project-management-app" in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code. This is the folder where we will create the necessary subfolders.

### Step 2: Create a Folder for Frontend Code

Inside the project folder, create a new folder named "frontend" to hold all the frontend code. This is where we will store HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other frontend-related files. 

You can create the folder using the following command in the integrated terminal:

```shell
mkdir frontend
```

### Step 3: Create a Folder for Backend Code

Similarly, create another folder named "backend" inside the project folder. This folder will contain all the backend code, such as server-side scripts, API endpoints, and database-related files.

Use the following command in the integrated terminal to create the folder:

```shell
mkdir backend
```

### Step 4: Verify the Folder Structure

After creating the "frontend" and "backend" folders, verify that the project folder structure looks like this:

```
project-management-app/
  ├── frontend/
  └── backend/
```

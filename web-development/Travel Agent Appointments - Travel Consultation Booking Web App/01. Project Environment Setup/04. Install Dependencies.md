1. **Open the command line**: Ensure that you have the command line interface (CLI) or terminal open on your machine. You can use the built-in terminal on your code editor or open a separate terminal window.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory where you initialized your Node.js project. If you're not already inside the project directory, run the following command:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

   Replace `path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.

3. **Install Express.js**: Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. To install Express.js, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

   This command tells npm to install the latest version of the Express.js package and its dependencies. Wait for the installation process to complete.

4. **Install MongoDB**: If you plan to use MongoDB as your database, you need to install the MongoDB driver for Node.js. Run the following command to install the official MongoDB driver:

   ```bash
   npm install mongodb
   ```

   This command installs the MongoDB driver package and its dependencies.

5. **Install additional libraries or frameworks**: If you have any other libraries or frameworks you plan to use in your project, you can install them using npm. For example, if you want to install a library called `my-library`, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install my-library
   ```

   Replace `my-library` with the actual name of the library you want to install. Repeat this step for each additional library or framework you want to add to your project.

6. **Update the package.json file**: As you install dependencies, the `package.json` file in your project directory is automatically updated. It keeps track of the installed packages and their versions. You can view the updated `package.json` file to verify that the dependencies are listed correctly.

7. **Utilizing the installed dependencies**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start using them in your Node.js project. For example, if you installed Express.js, you can create a server using the Express.js framework.

   ```javascript
   // Import the Express.js module
   const express = require('express');
   
   // Create an instance of the Express.js app
   const app = express();
   
   // Define routes and other application logic
   
   // Start the server
   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

   This is just a basic example to demonstrate how to use the installed dependencies in your code. You can refer to the documentation or specific examples for each library or framework to learn more about their usage.

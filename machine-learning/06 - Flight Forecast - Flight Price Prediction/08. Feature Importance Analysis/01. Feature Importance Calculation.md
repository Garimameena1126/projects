# Feature Importance Analysis

In this task, we will analyze the importance of different features in predicting flight prices. Feature importance analysis helps us understand which factors have the most significant impact on flight prices according to the selected model. We will examine the feature importances provided by the model and visualize them to gain insights.

## Step 1: Train the Model

Before analyzing feature importances, we need to train the model using the preprocessed data. Refer to Module 3: Model Selection and Training for detailed instructions on how to select and train a regression model.

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Assuming you have preprocessed data stored in X_train and y_train

# Initialize the RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 2: Extract Feature Importances

Once the model is trained, we can extract the feature importances. Feature importances represent the relative importance of each feature in the prediction process.

```python
# Extract feature importances
importances = model.feature_importances_
```

## Step 3: Analyze Feature Importances

Now, let's analyze the feature importances to understand which features are the most important for predicting flight prices.

```python
# Get the names of the features
feature_names = X_train.columns

# Create a dictionary to store feature importances
feature_importance_dict = dict(zip(feature_names, importances))

# Sort the features by importance in descending order
sorted_features = sorted(feature_importance_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Print the feature importances
for feature, importance in sorted_features:
    print(f"{feature}: {importance}")
```

The code above will print the features along with their respective importances in descending order. This allows us to identify the most important features for predicting flight prices.

## Step 4: Visualize Feature Importances

Visualizing feature importances can provide a clearer understanding of the relative importance of each feature. We can use various visualization techniques, such as bar plots or heatmaps, to represent the feature importances.

Here's an example of how to create a bar plot using matplotlib to visualize the feature importances:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# Extract the top 10 features and their importances
top_features = sorted_features[:10]
features, importances = zip(*top_features)

# Create a bar plot
plt.bar(features, importances)

# Set the labels and title
plt.xlabel('Features')
plt.ylabel('Importance')
plt.title('Top 10 Features Importance')

# Rotate the x-axis labels for better readability
plt.xticks(rotation=45)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

In this example, we are visualizing the top 10 features and their corresponding importances in a bar plot. Adjust the number of features based on your preference and the number of features you want to visualize.

# Designing a Form to Add New Exercises to the Workout Log

In this task, we will design a form that allows users to add new exercises to their workout log. The form will collect information such as exercise name, duration, intensity, and date. Follow the steps below to create the form:

## Step 1: HTML Markup

1. Open the `index.html` file located in the `public` folder of your project.

2. Inside the `<body>` section, add a new `<form>` element to create the exercise entry form:

```html
<form>
  <!-- Form elements will be added here -->
</form>
```

## Step 2: Exercise Name

1. Inside the `<form>` element, add a `<label>` and an `<input>` element to collect the exercise name:

```html
<label for="exercise-name">Exercise Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="exercise-name" name="exercise-name" required>
```

2. The `<label>` element is used to provide a descriptive text for the input field. The `for` attribute of the `<label>` should match the `id` attribute of the `<input>` to associate them.

3. The `<input>` element of type `text` allows users to enter text for the exercise name. The `id` and `name` attributes are set to "exercise-name" for identification and form submission purposes.

4. The `required` attribute is added to make the exercise name field mandatory.

## Step 3: Exercise Duration

1. Add another `<label>` and `<input>` element to collect the exercise duration:

```html
<label for="exercise-duration">Exercise Duration (minutes):</label>
<input type="number" id="exercise-duration" name="exercise-duration" required>
```

2. This time, we use an `<input>` element of type `number` to accept a numerical value for the exercise duration. The `id` and `name` attributes are set to "exercise-duration".

3. The `required` attribute ensures that the duration field is mandatory.

## Step 4: Exercise Intensity

1. Add a `<label>` and a `<select>` element to allow users to choose the exercise intensity:

```html
<label for="exercise-intensity">Exercise Intensity:</label>
<select id="exercise-intensity" name="exercise-intensity" required>
  <option value="">-- Select Intensity --</option>
  <option value="low">Low</option>
  <option value="medium">Medium</option>
  <option value="high">High</option>
</select>
```

2. The `<select>` element creates a dropdown menu for selecting the exercise intensity. The `id` and `name` attributes are set to "exercise-intensity".

3. Inside the `<select>` element, we include `<option>` elements to define the available intensity options. The first `<option>` element with an empty value acts as a placeholder. Users will see this option as the default choice.

## Step 5: Exercise Date

1. Add a `<label>` and an `<input>` element of type `date` to collect the exercise date:

```html
<label for="exercise-date">Exercise Date:</label>
<input type="date" id="exercise-date" name="exercise-date" required>
```

2. The `<input>` element of type `date` provides a date picker for selecting the exercise date. The `id` and `name` attributes are set to "exercise-date".

3. The `required` attribute ensures that the date field is mandatory.

## Step 6: Submit Button

1. Add a submit button to allow users to submit the form:

```html
<button type="submit">

Add Exercise</button>
```

## Step 7: Complete HTML Markup

1. After adding all the necessary form elements, the final HTML markup for the exercise entry form should look like this:

```html
<form>
  <label for="exercise-name">Exercise Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="exercise-name" name="exercise-name" required>

  <label for="exercise-duration">Exercise Duration (minutes):</label>
  <input type="number" id="exercise-duration" name="exercise-duration" required>

  <label for="exercise-intensity">Exercise Intensity:</label>
  <select id="exercise-intensity" name="exercise-intensity" required>
    <option value="">-- Select Intensity --</option>
    <option value="low">Low</option>
    <option value="medium">Medium</option>
    <option value="high">High</option>
  </select>

  <label for="exercise-date">Exercise Date:</label>
  <input type="date" id="exercise-date" name="exercise-date" required>

  <button type="submit">Add Exercise</button>
</form>
```

## Step 8: Styling the Form

1. Open the `styles.css` file located in the `public` folder of your project (create one if it doesn't exist).

2. Add CSS styles to customize the appearance of the form elements. For example:

```css
form {
  width: 300px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

label {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 10px;
}

input,
select {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 5px;
  margin-top: 5px;
}

button {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 10px;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  background-color: #4caf50;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #45a049;
}
```

3. Save the `styles.css` file.

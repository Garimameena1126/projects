In this task, we will focus on creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of our sleep quality classification model. Feature engineering plays a crucial role in extracting relevant information from the data and enhancing the model's ability to capture patterns and make accurate predictions.

## Step 1: Load the Preprocessed Data

Before we begin feature engineering, make sure you have preprocessed the sleep-related data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature scaling. Load the preprocessed dataset into your project.

```python
# Load the preprocessed data
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_data.csv')
```

## Step 2: Analyze the Existing Features

Start by analyzing the existing features in the dataset. This analysis will help you identify potential transformations or combinations that could be relevant for sleep quality classification. Consider the following techniques to gain insights:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc., to understand the distribution and variability of each feature.
- **Data Visualization:** Plot histograms, box plots, scatter plots, or correlation matrices to visualize the relationships between features and their distributions.
- **Domain Knowledge:** Leverage your domain expertise or consult sleep experts to identify specific features that are known to influence sleep quality.

```python
# Analyze existing features
print(data.describe())  # Display summary statistics
```

## Step 3: Create New Features

Based on the analysis of existing features, create new features that might capture additional information relevant for sleep quality classification. Here are a few examples:

- **Sleep Regularity:** Calculate the standard deviation or coefficient of variation of sleep duration over a certain period to measure how consistent the sleep schedule is.
- **Bedtime Routine Score:** Assign a score based on the presence of a structured bedtime routine. For example, assign a higher score if a person consistently follows a routine of reading before bed.
- **Stress-Related Features:** Incorporate stress-related features, such as the number of stressful events experienced during the day or a score indicating stress levels measured using other methods.

```python
# Create new features
data['sleep_regularity'] = data['sleep_duration'].std()  # Sleep regularity
data['bedtime_routine_score'] = data['bedtime_routine'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'structured' else 0)  # Bedtime routine score
data['stress_events_count'] = data['stress_events'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split(',')))  # Stress events count
```

## Step 4: Transform Existing Features

In addition to creating new features, you can also transform existing ones to extract more meaningful information. Consider the following techniques:

- **Binning or Discretization:** Group continuous variables like sleep duration into bins or categories to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Normalization or Scaling:** Normalize features to a common scale, such as using z-score normalization or min-max scaling.
- **Polynomial Features:** Generate polynomial features by combining existing features through multiplication or interaction terms.

```python
# Transform existing features
data['sleep_duration_bin'] = pd.cut(data['sleep_duration'], bins=[0, 5, 8, float('inf')], labels=['short', 'moderate', 'long'])  # Binning sleep duration
data['normalized_stress'] = (data['stress_levels'] - data['stress_levels'].mean()) / data['stress_levels'].std()  # Z-score normalization
data['sleep_duration_squared'] = data['sleep_duration'] ** 2  # Polynomial feature
```

## Step 5: Drop Irrelevant Features

After creating new features and transforming existing ones, it's important to assess their relevance and potential impact on the model's performance. Some features may not contribute significantly to sleep quality classification and can be dropped to reduce noise and dimensionality.

```python
# Drop irrelevant features
data.drop(['bedtime_routine', 'stress_events'], axis=1, inplace=True)
```

## Step 6: Save the Updated Dataset

Once you have performed feature engineering, save the updated dataset for further steps in the project, such as model selection and training.

```python
# Save the updated dataset
data.to_csv('feature_engineered_data.csv', index=False)
```

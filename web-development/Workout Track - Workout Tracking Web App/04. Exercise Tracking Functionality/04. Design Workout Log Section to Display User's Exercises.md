# Designing a Section to Display the User's Workout Log

In this task, we will focus on designing a section of the workout tracking app that will display the user's workout log with exercise details. This section will provide users with a comprehensive view of their exercise history and progress. We will design a user-friendly interface and incorporate features such as pagination or infinite scrolling to enhance the usability of the workout log display. Let's get started!

## Step 1: HTML Structure

To begin, we will create the HTML structure for the workout log section. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file located in the `public` folder of your project.

2. Inside the `<body>` tag, add a new `<div>` element with a unique `id` attribute to serve as the container for the workout log section. You can choose any suitable name for the `id`, such as `workout-log`:

   ```html
   <div id="workout-log"></div>
   ```

   This empty `<div>` will be populated dynamically with exercise details later.

3. Save the changes to the `index.html` file.

## Step 2: CSS Styling

Next, we will apply CSS styling to the workout log section to enhance its appearance and layout. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new CSS file named `styles.css` inside the `public` folder.

2. Open the `styles.css` file.

3. Add the following CSS code to define the basic styling for the workout log section:

   ```css
   /* Styling for the workout log section */
   #workout-log {
     margin: 20px;
     padding: 20px;
     border: 1px solid #ccc;
     border-radius: 4px;
     background-color: #f9f9f9;
   }
   ```

   This code sets the margin, padding, border, and background color for the workout log section.

4. Save the changes to the `styles.css` file.

## Step 3: JavaScript Interaction

Now, we will use JavaScript to dynamically populate the workout log section with exercise details. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new JavaScript file named `workoutLog.js` inside the `src` folder.

2. Open the `workoutLog.js` file.

3. Add the following JavaScript code to retrieve the exercise data and populate the workout log section:

   ```javascript
   // Retrieve exercise data from the server (replace this with your actual implementation)
   function getExerciseData() {
     // Mock exercise data (replace this with your actual implementation)
     const exerciseData = [
       { id: 1, name: 'Push-ups', duration: '10 minutes' },
       { id: 2, name: 'Squats', duration: '15 minutes' },
       { id: 3, name: 'Plank', duration: '5 minutes' },
       // ...
     ];

     return exerciseData;
   }

   // Render exercise details in the workout log section
   function renderWorkoutLog() {
     const workoutLogContainer = document.getElementById('workout-log');

     // Retrieve exercise data
     const exerciseData = getExerciseData();

     // Check if exercise data is available
     if (exerciseData.length === 0) {
       workoutLogContainer.textContent = 'No exercise data available.';
       return;
     }

     // Create an HTML string to store the exercise details
     let workoutLogHTML = '';

     // Loop through the exercise data and create HTML elements for each exercise
     exerciseData.forEach((exercise) => {
       workoutLogHTML += `
         <div class="exercise">
           <h3>${exercise.name}</h3><p>Duration: ${exercise.duration}</p>
         </div>
       `;
     });

     // Set the generated HTML as the content of the workout log section
     workoutLogContainer.innerHTML = workoutLogHTML;
   }

   // Call the renderWorkoutLog function to populate the workout log section
   renderWorkoutLog();
   ```

   This code defines two functions: `getExerciseData` to retrieve exercise data (replace with your actual implementation) and `renderWorkoutLog` to render the exercise details in the workout log section. It uses JavaScript's DOM manipulation to dynamically generate HTML elements for each exercise and injects them into the workout log section.

4. Save the changes to the `workoutLog.js` file.

## Step 4: Linking CSS and JavaScript Files

Finally, we need to link the CSS and JavaScript files to the `index.html` file so that the styling and functionality are applied to the workout log section. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file located in the `public` folder.

2. Add the following `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` section to link the CSS file:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```

3. Add the following `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>` section to link the JavaScript file:

   ```html
   <script src="src/workoutLog.js"></script>
   ```

4. Save the changes to the `index.html` file.

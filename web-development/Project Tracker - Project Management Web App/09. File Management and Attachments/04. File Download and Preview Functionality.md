In this guide, we will explore how to enable users to download or preview uploaded files within your application.

## Step 1: Set Up File Storage and Retrieval

1. Ensure that you have implemented the file upload functionality as mentioned in Task 1: "Enable file uploads for project-related documents and attachments."
2. Make sure the uploaded files are stored in a location accessible to your application.

## Step 2: Generate File URLs

1. When a file is uploaded, generate a unique identifier or key for the file.
2. Create a route or endpoint in your application to handle file downloads or previews.

## Step 3: Downloading Files

1. When a user requests to download a file, retrieve the file from the storage location using the unique identifier or key.
2. Set the appropriate response headers to indicate the file's content type, length, and attachment disposition.
3. Stream the file content back to the user's browser as the response.

Here's an example in Node.js using Express:

```javascript
app.get('/download/:fileKey', (req, res) => {
  const fileKey = req.params.fileKey;

  // Retrieve the file from storage using the fileKey

  // Set appropriate response headers
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/octet-stream');
  res.setHeader('Content-Disposition', `attachment; filename=${fileName}`); // Provide the desired filename

  // Stream the file content as the response
  const fileStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
  fileStream.pipe(res);
});
```

## Step 4: Previewing Files

1. For file preview functionality, determine the appropriate way to display different file types. For example, you might use HTML `<img>` tags for images or embed PDFs using `<iframe>`.
2. Create a route or endpoint to handle file previews.

Here's an example of previewing an image using HTML and Express:

```javascript
app.get('/preview/:fileKey', (req, res) => {
  const fileKey = req.params.fileKey;

  // Retrieve the file from storage using the fileKey

  // Set appropriate response headers
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'image/jpeg'); // Adjust the content type based on the file type

  // Stream the file content as the response
  const fileStream = fs.createReadStream(filePath);
  fileStream.pipe(res);
});
```

## Step 5: Linking Files in the Application

1. In the appropriate sections of your application's user interface, provide links or buttons for users to download or preview the uploaded files.
2. Generate the appropriate URLs to the file download or preview routes based on the file's unique identifier or key.

For example, you might generate a download link in HTML like this:

```html
<a href="/download/FILE_KEY">Download File</a>
```

Or an image preview using HTML:

```html
<img src="/preview/FILE_KEY" alt="Preview Image">
```

Ensure that `FILE_KEY` is replaced with the actual unique identifier or key of the file.

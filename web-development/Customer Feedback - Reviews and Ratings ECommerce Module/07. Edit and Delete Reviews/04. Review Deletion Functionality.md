# Allowing Users to Delete Their Reviews with a Delete Button

In this guide, we will learn how to implement a delete button that allows users to delete their own reviews in our project. By providing this functionality, users can easily remove their reviews when needed. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Add the Delete Button to Review Display
To enable users to delete their reviews, we need to add a delete button to the review display section. Here's how to implement it:

1. Open the file that displays the review details or review list page (e.g., `review-details.ejs` or `review-list.ejs`).
2. Inside the HTML structure representing each review, add the following code for the delete button:
    ```html
    <form action="/reviews/<%= review.id %>?_method=DELETE" method="POST">
      <button type="submit" class="delete-button">Delete</button>
    </form>
    ```
Replace `<%= review.id %>` with the appropriate variable that holds the unique identifier of the review. Make sure to use the correct template engine syntax for variable interpolation (e.g., `<%= review.id %>`) based on your chosen technology (e.g., EJS, Handlebars).

In this example, we create a form with the `action` attribute set to the delete route for the specific review. We use the `method="POST"` attribute to submit the form. When the user clicks the delete button, it will trigger the delete request.

## Step 2: Implement the Delete Route
Next, we need to implement the server route that handles the delete request and removes the review from the database. Here's how to do it:

1. In your server file, find the route that handles the delete request (e.g., `/reviews/:id` with the DELETE method).
2. Inside the route handler function, add the following code to delete the review from the database:
    ```javascript
    app.delete('/reviews/:id', (req, res) => {
      const reviewId = req.params.id;
      
      // Delete the review from the database using the reviewId
      
      // Redirect the user to an appropriate page (e.g., review list page)
      res.redirect('/reviews');
    });
    ```

In this example, we retrieve the review's unique identifier (`reviewId`) from the request parameters. Then, we delete the corresponding review from the database. Finally, we redirect the user to an appropriate page (e.g., the review list page) after the deletion.

## Step 3: Test the Implementation
To test the deletion functionality for users' reviews, follow these steps:

1. Start your server by running the following command in your project directory:
    ```shell
    node app.js
    ```

2. Open your web application in a browser and navigate to a page that displays the review details or review list.

3. Locate a review that belongs to the currently logged-in user.

4. Click the delete button associated with that review.

5. Confirm the deletion if prompted.

6. Observe that the review is removed from the display or no longer appears on the review list page.

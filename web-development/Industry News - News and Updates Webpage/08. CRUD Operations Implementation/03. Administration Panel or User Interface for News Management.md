In this task, we will create an administration panel or user interface to manage the news articles in the project.

### Step 1: Set up the Frontend Environment

1. Create a new folder called `admin` in your project directory.
2. Open the command line or terminal and navigate to the `admin` folder.
3. Initialize a new frontend project using a framework of your choice (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
   ```bash
   # For React
   npx create-react-app .
   ```
4. Wait for the project setup to complete.

### Step 2: Design the Administration Panel

1. Open the `admin/src` folder in your code editor.
2. Update the `App.js` component to display the administration panel.
   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Administration Panel</h1>
         {/* Add your components and functionality here */}
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```
3. Create the necessary components for managing news articles (e.g., NewsList, NewsForm, NewsDetail, etc.). These components will handle displaying a list of news articles, creating new articles, updating existing articles, and viewing article details.
4. Style the components using CSS or a styling framework of your choice to create a visually appealing administration panel.

### Step 3: Connect the Frontend to the Backend API

1. Open the file where you set up the backend server (e.g., `server.js`).
2. Install the necessary packages to enable CORS and handle API requests.
   ```bash
   npm install cors axios
   ```
3. Import the packages at the top of the server file.
   ```javascript
   const cors = require('cors');
   const axios = require('axios');
   ```
4. Enable CORS for your backend server by adding the following code before defining your routes.
   ```javascript
   app.use(cors());
   ```
5. Implement API endpoints in your backend server to handle the CRUD operations for news articles (e.g., create, read, update, delete).
6. Update your frontend components to make API requests to the backend server for managing the news articles.
   - Use the `axios` library or any other library of your choice to send HTTP requests to the backend API.
   - Create functions within your frontend components to handle the API requests for creating, reading, updating, and deleting news articles.
   - Make use of hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) or state management libraries (e.g., Redux) to manage the data retrieved from the backend and update the component state accordingly.

### Step 4: Test and Refine the Administration Panel

1. Start the backend server and the frontend development server.
   ```bash
   # Start the backend server
   node server.js

   # Start the frontend development server
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the administration panel URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/admin`).
3. Test the functionality of the administration panel by performing CRUD operations on the news articles.
   - Create new articles, update existing articles, and delete articles using the provided forms and UI elements.
   - Verify that the changes are reflected in the backend database and displayed correctly in the administration panel.
4. Refine the administration panel's design and functionality as needed, based on user experience and project requirements.

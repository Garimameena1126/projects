# Handling Class Imbalance in the Dataset

In this guide, we will address the issue of class imbalance in the dataset for our customer churn prediction project. Class imbalance occurs when one class (in this case, churned customers) is significantly underrepresented compared to the other class (non-churned customers). As customer churn may be a relatively rare event, it is crucial to handle class imbalance to ensure that our machine learning model can effectively learn and make accurate predictions.

To address class imbalance, we will explore two common techniques: oversampling and undersampling. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class. We will discuss both techniques and provide code examples to demonstrate their implementation.

## 1. Oversampling the Minority Class

Oversampling aims to balance the dataset by increasing the number of instances in the minority class. This technique can be particularly useful when the available data for the minority class is limited. One popular oversampling method is Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). SMOTE generates synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class instances.

Here are the steps to oversample the minority class using SMOTE:

### Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
```

### Step 2: Load the preprocessed dataset

Assuming you have already preprocessed the dataset and stored it in a pandas DataFrame named `df`, we will use this DataFrame for oversampling.

```python
# Load the preprocessed dataset
df = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_dataset.csv')
```

### Step 3: Separate the features and target variable

```python
# Separate the features and target variable
X = df.drop('churn', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['churn']  # Target variable
```

### Step 4: Apply SMOTE oversampling

```python
# Apply SMOTE oversampling
smote = SMOTE()
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
```

In the above code snippet, `X_resampled` and `y_resampled` represent the oversampled feature matrix and target variable, respectively.

## 2. Undersampling the Majority Class

Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. This technique can be useful when the dataset has a large number of instances in the majority class that may contribute to overfitting or biasing the model toward that class. A common technique for undersampling is Random Undersampling.

Let's go through the steps to perform undersampling using Random Undersampling:

### Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler
```

### Step 2: Load the preprocessed dataset

Assuming you have already preprocessed the dataset and stored it in a pandas DataFrame named `df`, we will use this DataFrame for undersampling.

```python
# Load the preprocessed dataset
df = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_dataset.csv')
```

### Step 3: Separate the features and target variable

```python
# Separate the features and target variable
X = df.drop('churn', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['churn']  # Target variable
```

### Step 4: Apply Random Undersampling

```python
# Apply Random Undersampling
rus = RandomUnderSampler()
X_resampled, y_resampled = rus.fit_resample(X, y)
```

In the above code snippet, `X_resampled` and `y_resampled` represent the

 undersampled feature matrix and target variable, respectively.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we addressed the issue of class imbalance in the dataset for our customer churn prediction project. We discussed two common techniques, oversampling and undersampling, and provided code examples to demonstrate their implementation. By applying these techniques, we can create a balanced dataset that can improve the performance and reliability of our machine learning model in predicting customer churn.

Remember, class imbalance handling is an optional module. If you decide not to address class imbalance, you can skip this step and proceed to the next module in the project.

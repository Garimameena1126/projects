# Task: Secure User Profile Routes to Only Allow Access to Authenticated Users

In this task, we will focus on securing the user profile routes to ensure that only authenticated users can access them. By implementing this security measure, we will prevent unauthorized access to sensitive user information. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Implement User Authentication

Before securing the user profile routes, ensure that you have implemented user authentication functionality in your project. User authentication typically involves user registration, login, and session management. Users should be able to create an account, log in with their credentials, and maintain an active session.

## Step 2: Identify User Profile Routes

Identify the routes in your project that correspond to user profile pages. These routes are responsible for rendering the user profile page and displaying user-specific information. Depending on your project's structure and routing system, these routes might include URLs such as `/profile` or `/users/:id`.

## Step 3: Create Middleware for Authentication

In order to secure the user profile routes, we will create a middleware function that checks if the user is authenticated before allowing access to these routes. The middleware function will intercept incoming requests and verify the user's authentication status.

```javascript
// Example middleware for user authentication
function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  // Check if user is authenticated
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    // User is authenticated, proceed to the next middleware or route handler
    return next();
  }
  // User is not authenticated, redirect to login page or display an error
  res.redirect('/login');
}
```

In this example, we define a middleware function named `isAuthenticated`. The function checks if the user is authenticated using the `req.isAuthenticated()` method. If the user is authenticated, the function calls `next()` to pass control to the next middleware or route handler. If the user is not authenticated, the function redirects the user to the login page or displays an error message.

## Step 4: Apply Middleware to User Profile Routes

Apply the `isAuthenticated` middleware to the user profile routes. This will ensure that only authenticated users can access these routes. The exact implementation will depend on your project's routing system. Here's an example using Express.js:

```javascript
// Apply the isAuthenticated middleware to user profile routes
app.get('/profile', isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
  // Render the user profile page
  res.render('profile');
});
```

In this example, the `isAuthenticated` middleware is applied to the `/profile` route using `app.get()`. The middleware function is passed as a second argument, ensuring that it is executed before rendering the user profile page.

## Step 5: Test the Secured User Profile Routes

To verify that the user profile routes are secured, test the application by attempting to access the user profile pages without being authenticated. The routes should redirect to the login page or display an appropriate error message.

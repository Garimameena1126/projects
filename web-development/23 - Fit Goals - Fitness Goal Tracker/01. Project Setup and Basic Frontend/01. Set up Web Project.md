In this guide, we will walk through the process of setting up a new web project using a frontend framework. We will assume that you have already chosen your preferred frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js). Let's get started!

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Before we begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

To verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you see version numbers printed out for both commands, you're good to go!

### Step 2: Create a New Project Directory

Choose a suitable location on your computer and create a new directory for your web project. You can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt to create the directory:

```bash
mkdir my-web-project
```

Navigate into the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd my-web-project
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Project

Once inside the project directory, initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command creates a `package.json` file that will store information about your project and its dependencies.

### Step 4: Install the Frontend Framework

Next, you need to install the frontend framework of your choice. Replace `[framework]` with the actual name of the framework you are using (e.g., `react`, `angular`, `vue`), and run the appropriate command:

For React:
```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

For Angular:
```bash
npm install @angular/core @angular/common @angular/compiler @angular/platform-browser @angular/platform-browser-dynamic
```

For Vue.js:
```bash
npm install vue
```

This command installs the necessary packages and dependencies required for your chosen framework.

### Step 5: Create the Project Structure

Now it's time to create the basic structure of your website. Inside your project directory, create the following files:

- `index.html`: This will be the main HTML file for your website.
- `styles.css`: This file will contain your CSS styles.
- `app.js` (or a similar name): This file will hold your JavaScript code.

You can create these files using a text editor or through terminal commands. For example:

```bash
touch index.html styles.css app.js
```

### Step 6: Configure the HTML File

Open the `index.html` file in your preferred text editor and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Web Project</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code sets up the basic structure of an HTML file and links the CSS and JavaScript files to it.

### Step 7: Add the Navigation Bar and Footer

To set up a navigation bar and footer for your website, you can use the appropriate HTML and CSS code. Here's an example:

```html
<!-- Inside index.html -->

<body>
    <header>
        <nav>
            <!-- Navigation bar code goes here -->
        </nav>
    </header>
    


    <!-- Main content of your website -->
    
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer code goes here -->
    </footer>
    
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
```

You can customize the navigation bar and footer according to your design preferences.

### Step 8: Create a Landing Page

Now, let's create a landing page that welcomes users to the Fitness Goal Tracker. Add the necessary HTML and CSS code to the main content section of your `index.html` file:

```html
<!-- Inside index.html -->

<body>
    <header>
        <nav>
            <!-- Navigation bar code goes here -->
        </nav>
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <section class="landing">
            <h1>Welcome to the Fitness Goal Tracker!</h1>
            <p>Start tracking your fitness goals today.</p>
            <a href="#">Get Started</a>
        </section>
    </main>
    
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer code goes here -->
    </footer>
    
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
```

Feel free to add more content and styling to the landing page as per your requirements.

### Step 9: Run the Project

To see your web project in action, you need to set up a development server. Depending on your chosen framework, there are different ways to do this. Here are some common commands:

For React:
```bash
npm start
```

For Angular:
```bash
ng serve
```

For Vue.js:
```bash
npm run serve
```

These commands start a local development server and open your web project in a web browser. You should be able to see your landing page with the navigation bar and footer.


## Implement Basic Validation for Required Fields

In this guide, we will enhance our project management app by adding basic validation to ensure that the required fields are filled out when creating new projects or tasks.

### Step 1: Set up the HTML Structure

Ensure you have already created the static HTML page to display the list of existing projects and tasks, as outlined in the previous guides. Make sure you have identified the required fields for creating new projects or tasks and added appropriate attributes to them, such as `required`.

### Step 2: Add JavaScript to the HTML Page

Inside the `<script>` tag in your HTML file, add the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Function to validate the form inputs
function validateForm() {
  const projectInput = document.getElementById('projectInput');
  const taskInput = document.getElementById('taskInput');
  
  // Check if the required fields are filled out
  if (projectInput.value.trim() === '') {
    alert('Please enter a project name.');
    return false;
  }
  
  if (taskInput.value.trim() === '') {
    alert('Please enter a task description.');
    return false;
  }
  
  // If all validations pass, submit the form
  return true;
}

// Attach the event listener to the form submission
const form = document.getElementById('projectForm');
form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
  
  // Call the validateForm function before submitting the form
  if (validateForm()) {
    // If the form is valid, you can perform further actions, such as adding the project/task to the list
    // Example: addProject();
    // Example: addTask();
    
    // Clear the form inputs after submission
    form.reset();
  }
});
```

### Step 3: Update HTML Form

Update your HTML file to include the necessary form elements and attributes. Make sure you add an appropriate ID to the form and the required attributes to the input fields.

```html
<!-- Example form for creating new projects or tasks -->
<form id="projectForm">
  <input type="text" id="projectInput" placeholder="Project Name" required>
  <input type="text" id="taskInput" placeholder="Task Description" required>
  <button type="submit">Add Project/Task</button>
</form>
```

### Step 4: Test the Functionality

Save the HTML file and open it in a web browser. Try submitting the form without filling out the required fields, and you should see an alert message prompting you to fill in the missing information.

Only when all the required fields are filled out, the form will be submitted, and you can proceed with further actions, such as adding the project or task to the list.

### Step 5: Customize the Functionality

You can customize the JavaScript code to match your specific validation requirements. For example, you can add additional validation checks or implement more complex validation logic.

Additionally, you may need to update the CSS styles to provide visual cues or error messages for the required fields that are not filled out.

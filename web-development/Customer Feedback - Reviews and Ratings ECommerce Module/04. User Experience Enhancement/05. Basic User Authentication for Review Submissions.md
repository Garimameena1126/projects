# Beginner's Guide: Implementing Basic User Authentication for Review Submissions

In this guide, we will implement basic user authentication to restrict review submissions to logged-in users. This feature will enhance the user experience by ensuring that only authenticated users can submit reviews.

## Step 1: Set Up User Authentication System
Before we can implement user authentication, we need to set up a user authentication system. This typically involves creating a user model, setting up user registration and login routes, and handling user sessions.

### Example: User Model (Python - Flask)

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)

    def __init__(self, username, password):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
```

In this example, we define a `User` model using SQLAlchemy in Flask. The model includes fields for the user's `id`, `username`, and `password`. Adapt this code to match your specific backend framework and database system.

## Step 2: Create Registration and Login Routes
Next, we need to create routes for user registration and login. These routes will handle the user input, validate the credentials, and establish a session for the logged-in user.

### Example: Registration and Login Routes (Python - Flask)

```python
from flask import Flask, request, session, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'

@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Process registration form data
        username = request.form.get('username')
        password = request.form.get('password')

        # Create a new user and save it to the database
        user = User(username, password)
        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()

        # Redirect to the login page
        return redirect('/login')

    # Render the registration form
    return '''
        <form method="POST" action="/register">
            <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required><br>
            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required><br>
            <input type="submit" value="Register">
        </form>
    '''

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Process login form data
        username = request.form.get('username')
        password = request.form.get('password')

        # Validate user credentials
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
        if user and user.password == password:
            # Set user session
            session['user_id'] = user.id

            # Redirect to the review submission page
            return redirect('/submit-review')

        # Invalid credentials, show error message
        return 'Invalid username or password'

    # Render the login form
    return '''
        <form method="POST" action="/login">
            <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required><br>
            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required><br>
            <input type="submit" value="Login">
        </form>
    '''
```

In this example, we define two routes: `/register` for user registration and `/login` for user login. The registration route handles the form submission, creates a new user, and saves it to the database. The login route verifies the user's credentials, sets a session variable (`user_id`), and redirects the user to

 the review submission page if the credentials are valid.

Make sure to adapt the code to match your backend framework and template engine. Also, update the database interaction code based on your specific database system.

## Step 3: Restrict Review Submission to Authenticated Users
Now that we have the user authentication system in place, we can restrict the review submission functionality to only authenticated users.

### Example: Restricting Review Submission (JavaScript)

```javascript
// Assuming you have an existing function to handle review submission

function submitReview(review) {
  if (isLoggedIn()) {
    // Submit the review
    // ...
  } else {
    alert('Please log in to submit a review.');
  }
}

function isLoggedIn() {
  // Check if the user is logged in by verifying the presence of the session variable
  return session['user_id'] !== undefined;
}
```

In this example, the `submitReview` function checks if the user is logged in by calling the `isLoggedIn` function. If the user is logged in, the review is submitted as usual. If not, an alert is displayed, notifying the user to log in before submitting a review.

Remember to adapt this code to fit your frontend framework and the way you handle review submissions.

## Step 4: Test and Refine
Test the user authentication and review submission functionality by registering new users, logging in with different accounts, and submitting reviews. Verify that only authenticated users can successfully submit reviews, and non-authenticated users receive the appropriate error message.

Make any necessary refinements to the authentication logic, registration/login forms, or error handling based on user feedback or additional requirements.

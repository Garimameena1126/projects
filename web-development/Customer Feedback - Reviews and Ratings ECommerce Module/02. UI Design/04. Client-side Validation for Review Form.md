# Beginner's Guide: Adding Basic Client-Side Validation for the Review Form

In this guide, we will focus on adding basic client-side validation to the review form of your reviews and ratings system. Client-side validation helps ensure that the data entered by users meets specific criteria before it is submitted. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions and code examples to help beginners implement this validation.

## Step 1: Open the HTML File

Make sure you have the HTML file (`index.html`) open in your preferred text editor. This file should contain the main HTML structure and the form for submitting reviews.

## Step 2: Add Validation Rules

Before implementing the validation logic, let's define the validation rules for each field in the form. Determine the criteria that the user input should meet. For example, you might want to require a minimum length for the review text or validate that the rating is within a certain range.

Here's an example of the validation rules you could use:

- The review text must be at least 10 characters long.
- The rating must be a number between 1 and 5.

Keep these rules in mind as we proceed to the next steps.

## Step 3: Select Form Elements

To perform validation, we need to select the form elements using JavaScript. Let's start by selecting the necessary elements in the HTML file.

Add the following `id` attributes to the respective form elements in the HTML:

```html
<input type="text" id="review-text" name="review-text">

<select id="rating" name="rating">
  <!-- Rating options -->
</select>

<button type="submit" id="submit-btn">Submit</button>
```

We have assigned `id` attributes to the review text input field, rating select field, and the submit button. These `id`s will be used to select the elements in JavaScript.

## Step 4: Create a JavaScript File

To add client-side validation, we need to write JavaScript code. Create a new JavaScript file in the same directory as your HTML file. Name it `validation.js` and open it in your text editor.

## Step 5: Connect JavaScript File to HTML

In the HTML file, include the JavaScript file by adding the following line just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="validation.js"></script>
```

This line tells the browser to load the `validation.js` file and execute its code.

## Step 6: Implement Validation Logic

In the `validation.js` file, write the JavaScript code to implement the validation logic. We'll use the `addEventListener()` method to listen for form submission and perform the validation checks before allowing the form to be submitted.

Add the following code to your `validation.js` file:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  // Select form elements
  const reviewText = document.getElementById('review-text');
  const rating = document.getElementById('rating');
  const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submit-btn');

  // Add form submission event listener
  submitBtn.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    // Prevent form submission
    event.preventDefault();

    // Perform validation
    if (reviewText.value.length < 10) {
      alert('Please enter a review with at least 10 characters.');
    } else if (rating.value < 1 || rating.value > 5) {
      alert('Please select a rating between 1 and 5.');
    } else {
      // Validation passed, submit the form
      event.target.closest('form').submit();
    }
  });
});
```

In this code, we first select the form elements (`reviewText`, `rating`, and `submitBtn`) using their respective `id`s.

We then add an event listener to the submit button (`

submitBtn`) using the `addEventListener()` method. The listener function is executed when the submit button is clicked.

Inside the event listener function, we prevent the default form submission behavior using `event.preventDefault()`. This allows us to perform our own validation logic before submitting the form.

We then check the validation rules we defined earlier. If any validation rule fails, an alert message is displayed to the user. If all validation checks pass, the form is submitted programmatically using `event.target.closest('form').submit()`.

## Step 7: Test the Validation

Save both the HTML and JavaScript files, and open the HTML file in your web browser. Now, when you fill in the review form and click the submit button, the validation logic will be triggered.

Try entering a review text with less than 10 characters or selecting a rating outside the range of 1 to 5. You should see the respective alert messages informing you of the validation requirements.

If you meet the validation criteria, the form will be submitted successfully.

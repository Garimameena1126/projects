1. Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Make sure you have set up the basic project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as explained in the previous guide.

3. Create a new file in the project folder and name it `products.json`. The `.json` extension indicates that this file will store data in JSON format.

4. Open the `products.json` file in your text editor.

5. Define an array of objects inside the JSON file. Each object represents a product and contains properties such as `name`, `image`, and `price`. Here's an example structure for two products:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "name": "Product 1",
       "image": "path/to/product1-image.jpg",
       "price": 19.99
     },
     {
       "name": "Product 2",
       "image": "path/to/product2-image.jpg",
       "price": 29.99
     }
   ]
   ```

   Customize the values for each product according to your project requirements. You can add more products by including additional objects inside the array.

6. Save the `products.json` file.

#  Sleep Quality Classification for user input

In this module, we will utilize the trained machine learning model to classify sleep quality based on user input of various features related to sleep. We will develop a simple command-line application where users can input their sleep-related information, and the model will predict their sleep quality. Follow the step-by-step guide below to accomplish this task.

## Step 1: Load the Trained Model

First, we need to load the trained machine learning model that was previously trained in Module 3. Assuming you have saved the trained model to a file (e.g., `model.pkl`), you can load it using the following code:

```python
import pickle

# Load the trained model from file
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)
```

Make sure to replace `'model.pkl'` with the correct path to your saved model file.

## Step 2: Gather User Input

Next, we need to gather user input for the sleep-related features. These features could include sleep duration, bedtime routine, exercise, stress levels, and any other relevant information. You can prompt the user for input using the `input()` function and store the values in variables.

```python
# Gather user input for sleep-related features
sleep_duration = float(input("Enter sleep duration (in hours): "))
bedtime_routine = input("Enter bedtime routine: ")
exercise = input("Enter exercise details: ")
stress_levels = input("Enter stress levels (low, medium, high): ")
```

Feel free to modify the prompts and variable names according to your specific requirements.

## Step 3: Preprocess User Input

After gathering user input, we need to preprocess the input data to ensure it is in the correct format for the model to make predictions. This preprocessing step should be consistent with the preprocessing performed on the training data in Module 2.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from the user input
user_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'sleep_duration': [sleep_duration],
    'bedtime_routine': [bedtime_routine],
    'exercise': [exercise],
    'stress_levels': [stress_levels]
})

# Perform the same preprocessing steps as in Module 2
# ... (code for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.)
```

Make sure to apply the same preprocessing techniques that were used during training, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

## Step 4: Make Sleep Quality Prediction

Now that the user input has been preprocessed, we can use the trained model to make a prediction of the sleep quality based on the provided features. Apply the same transformations to the user data as were applied to the training data before making predictions.

```python
# Make sleep quality prediction using the trained model
sleep_quality_prediction = model.predict(user_data)

# Print the predicted sleep quality
print("Predicted sleep quality: ", sleep_quality_prediction[0])
```

The predicted sleep quality can be obtained by calling the `predict()` method of the trained model and passing the preprocessed user data. Note that the predicted sleep quality may be represented as numeric values or categorical labels, depending on the specific classification model used.

## Step 5: Run the Command-Line Application

To create a command-line application that allows users to input their sleep-related information and receive a sleep quality prediction, we can wrap the above steps in a loop. This will allow the application to continue accepting user input until the user decides to exit.

```python
# Command-line application loop
while True:
    sleep_duration = float(input("Enter sleep duration (in hours): "))
    bedtime_routine = input("Enter bedtime routine: ")
    exercise = input("

Enter exercise details: ")
    stress_levels = input("Enter stress levels (low, medium, high): ")

    user_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'sleep_duration': [sleep_duration],
        'bedtime_routine': [bedtime_routine],
        'exercise': [exercise],
        'stress_levels': [stress_levels]
    })

    # Preprocess the user input
    # ... (code for preprocessing)

    # Make sleep quality prediction
    sleep_quality_prediction = model.predict(user_data)
    print("Predicted sleep quality: ", sleep_quality_prediction[0])

    # Prompt the user to continue or exit the application
    choice = input("Do you want to continue (Y/N)? ")
    if choice.lower() == 'n':
        break
```

# Designing and Creating the Homepage with a Hero Section

In this guide, we will focus on designing and creating the homepage for our Travel Agency website. The homepage will feature a hero section that showcases the agency's services and creates an engaging introduction for visitors.

## Step 1: Open the HTML File
1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor of your choice. This file is located inside the `pages` folder of your project.

## Step 2: Design the Hero Section
1. Inside the `<body>` tags of the `index.html` file, locate the opening and closing `<header>` tags. If they don't exist, add them at an appropriate location within the `<body>` tags.

2. Design the hero section by adding the necessary HTML markup and content. Here's an example code snippet to create a basic hero section:

```html
<section class="hero">
    <div class="hero-content">
        <h1>Welcome to Travel Agency</h1>
        <p>Explore the World with Us</p>
        <a href="#" class="btn">Discover More</a>
    </div>
</section>
```

Let's break down the code:

- `<section class="hero">`: This creates a `<section>` element with the class "hero" to define the hero section.
- `<div class="hero-content">`: This creates a `<div>` element with the class "hero-content" to encapsulate the content within the hero section.
- `<h1>Welcome to Travel Agency</h1>`: This adds a level-one heading (`<h1>`) for the welcome message or agency name.
- `<p>Explore the World with Us</p>`: This adds a paragraph (`<p>`) for a brief description or tagline.
- `<a href="#" class="btn">Discover More</a>`: This adds an anchor link (`<a>`) styled as a button with the class "btn". Replace the "#" with the actual link once it is ready.

Feel free to modify the content and styling of the hero section according to your design preferences.

## Step 3: Style the Hero Section
1. To style the hero section, you can add CSS code to the `style.css` file located in the `css` folder of your project. If the file doesn't exist, create it inside the `css` folder.

2. Open the `style.css` file in a text editor and add the following code:

```css
/* Style the hero section */
section.hero {
  background-image: url("path/to/your-image.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  height: 600px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.hero-content {
  text-align: center;
  color: #fff;
}

.hero-content h1 {
  font-size: 36px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.hero-content p {
  font-size: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}

.hero-content .btn {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 12px 24px;
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

The code above provides some basic styling for the hero section. It sets a background image using the `url()` function with the path to your desired image. Adjust the path accordingly. The background image is set to cover the entire section, positioned at the center. The height of the section is set to 600 pixels.

The `display: flex` property is used to vertically and horizontally center the content within the hero section. The `.hero-content` class styles the text elements, including the heading, description, and button.

## Step 4: Save the Changes and Review
1. Save the changes made to the `index.html` and `style.css` files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to review the homepage with the hero section showcasing the agency's services.

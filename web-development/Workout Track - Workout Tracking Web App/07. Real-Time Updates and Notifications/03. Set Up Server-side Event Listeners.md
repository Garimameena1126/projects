In this task, we will set up server-side event listeners to detect changes in the workout data. This will allow us to track updates in real-time and notify connected clients when there are changes. We will use the WebSocket technology for real-time communication.

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It enables real-time communication between the client and the server, allowing for efficient and reliable data transfer.

Follow the step-by-step guide below to set up server-side event listeners using WebSocket:

### Step 1: Install WebSocket Library

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory if you're not already there.

3. Install a WebSocket library. In this guide, we will use the `ws` library, which is a popular WebSocket library for Node.js. Run the following command to install the `ws` library:

   ```bash
   npm install ws
   ```

   This command will download and install the `ws` library from the npm registry.

### Step 2: Create a WebSocket Server

1. In your project directory, create a new file called `server.js`.

2. Open `server.js` in your preferred code editor.

3. Import the `ws` library at the top of the file by adding the following line:

   ```javascript
   const WebSocket = require('ws');
   ```

4. Create a WebSocket server by instantiating a new `WebSocket.Server` object. Add the following code:

   ```javascript
   const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });
   ```

   This code creates a WebSocket server that listens on port 8080.

### Step 3: Set Up Event Listeners

1. Add an event listener for the `connection` event to handle new WebSocket connections. Inside the event listener, log a message to indicate a new client has connected. Add the following code:

   ```javascript
   wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
     console.log('New client connected');
   });
   ```

   This code will execute whenever a new client connects to the WebSocket server.

2. Add an event listener for the `message` event to handle incoming messages from clients. Inside the event listener, log the received message. Add the following code:

   ```javascript
   wss.on('message', (message) => {
     console.log(`Received message: ${message}`);
   });
   ```

   This code will execute whenever the server receives a message from a client.

3. Add an event listener for the `close` event to handle client disconnections. Inside the event listener, log a message to indicate a client has disconnected. Add the following code:

   ```javascript
   wss.on('close', () => {
     console.log('Client disconnected');
   });
   ```

   This code will execute whenever a client disconnects from the WebSocket server.

### Step 4: Start the WebSocket Server

1. Add the following code at the end of the `server.js` file to start the WebSocket server:

   ```javascript
   wss.on('listening', () => {
     console.log('WebSocket server started');
   });
   
   wss.on('error', (error) => {
     console.error(`WebSocket server error: ${error}`);
   });
   
   wss.on('close', () => {
     console.log('WebSocket server closed');
   });
   ```

   This code sets up event listeners to handle server start, error, and close events.

2. Save the `server.js` file.

### Step 5: Run the WebSocket Server



1. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory if you're not already there.

2. Run the following command to start the WebSocket server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   This command will execute the `server.js` file and start the WebSocket server.

3. Observe the terminal output to ensure the server started successfully without any errors.

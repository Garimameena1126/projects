# Email Verification and Password Reset Functionality

In this guide, we will learn how to implement email verification and password reset functionality in the Promo Deals - Discount Coupons Ecommerce Module. These features are essential for user registration and authentication to ensure the security and validity of user accounts. We will provide step-by-step instructions along with code snippets to help you build these features effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following requirements in place:

- A working development environment for web development (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Node.js, etc.).
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with a server-side programming language (e.g., Node.js, PHP, etc.).
- Access to a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Let's dive into the implementation of email verification and password reset functionality.

## 1. Email Verification

### 1.1. Sending the Verification Email

When a user registers an account, we need to send a verification email to their provided email address. This email will contain a unique verification link that the user needs to click to confirm their email address. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Install a package like Nodemailer in your Node.js project to send emails:

   ```bash
   npm install nodemailer
   ```

2. Import the necessary modules and set up the transporter for sending emails:

   ```javascript
   const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

   // Create a transporter
   const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
     // Configure the email provider settings (SMTP, API, etc.)
   });
   ```

3. Implement a function to send the verification email:

   ```javascript
   const sendVerificationEmail = (email, verificationLink) => {
     const mailOptions = {
       from: 'your_email@example.com',
       to: email,
       subject: 'Verify your email address',
       html: `Click the following link to verify your email address: <a href="${verificationLink}">${verificationLink}</a>`,
     };

     transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
       if (error) {
         console.error(error);
       } else {
         console.log('Verification email sent:', info.response);
       }
     });
   };
   ```

4. Call the `sendVerificationEmail` function after a successful user registration, passing the user's email and the verification link as arguments.

### 1.2. Verifying the Email

Once the user clicks the verification link in the email, we need to verify their email address. Here's how you can implement this functionality:

1. Define a route in your server to handle email verification:

   ```javascript
   app.get('/verify-email/:token', (req, res) => {
     const token = req.params.token;

     // Validate the token and mark the user's email as verified
   });
   ```

2. When generating the verification link, include a unique token that represents the user and their email. This token can be generated using a package like `jsonwebtoken`:

   ```javascript
   const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

   const generateVerificationToken = (userEmail) => {
     const secretKey = 'your_secret_key';
     const token = jwt.sign({ email: userEmail }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });
     return token;
   };
   ```

3. When the user clicks the verification link, validate the token and mark the user's email as verified in your database.

## 2. Password Reset

### 2.1. Requesting Password Reset

To allow users to reset their passwords, we need to implement a functionality to handle password reset requests. Here's how you can do it:

1. Define a route to handle password reset requests:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/reset-password', (req, res) => {
     const email = req.body.email;

     // Generate a reset token and send it to the user's email
   });
   ```

2. Generate a reset token using a package like `jsonwebtoken`:

   ```javascript
   const generateResetToken = (userEmail) => {
     const secretKey = 'your_secret_key';
     const token = jwt.sign({ email: userEmail }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });
     return token;
   };
   ```

3. Send the reset token to the user's email address using the `sendVerificationEmail` function we defined earlier.

### 2.2. Resetting the Password

When the user receives the reset token, they can use it to reset their password. Here's how you can implement this functionality:

1. Define a route to handle password reset:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/reset-password/:token', (req, res) => {
     const token = req.params.token;
     const newPassword = req.body.newPassword;

     // Validate the token and update the user's password
   });
   ```

2. Validate the reset token and update the user's password in your database.

1. **Choose a server-side programming language or framework**: Select a programming language or framework that you are comfortable with for the server-side implementation. Common choices include Node.js with Express, Python with Django or Flask, Ruby with Ruby on Rails, or PHP with Laravel.

2. **Set up a server environment**: Set up a server environment to host your server-side code. This can be a local development environment or a cloud-based server. Ensure that the server environment meets the requirements of your chosen programming language or framework.

3. **Install necessary dependencies**: Install any required dependencies or libraries for your chosen programming language or framework. These dependencies may include packages for handling HTTP requests, routing, and processing JSON data.

4. **Obtain API credentials**: Contact the payment gateway provider and obtain the necessary API credentials. These credentials typically include an API key or access token that allows your server-side code to communicate with the payment gateway's API.

5. **Set up API routes**: Define the necessary API routes in your server-side code to handle payment requests and responses. These routes will receive payment-related data from the client-side and communicate with the payment gateway's API.

   ```javascript
   // Example API route setup using Express.js (Node.js)
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();
   
   // Handle payment request
   router.post('/payment', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       // Retrieve payment data from the request body
       const paymentData = req.body;
       
       // Process payment using the payment gateway API
       const paymentResult = await paymentGateway.processPayment(paymentData);
       
       // Handle the payment result and send response back to the client-side
       res.json(paymentResult);
     } catch (error) {
       // Handle any errors that occurred during payment processing
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Payment processing failed' });
     }
   });
   
   module.exports = router;
   ```

6. **Implement payment processing logic**: In the API route defined above, implement the payment processing logic using the payment gateway's API. This typically involves making HTTP requests to the payment gateway's API endpoints, passing the necessary payment data, and receiving the payment response.

   ```javascript
   // Example payment processing logic using the payment gateway's API
   const axios = require('axios');
   
   async function processPayment(paymentData) {
     try {
       // Make a POST request to the payment gateway's API endpoint
       const response = await axios.post('https://api.paymentgateway.com/payments', paymentData, {
         headers: {
           'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
           'Content-Type': 'application/json',
         },
       });
       
       // Extract the payment result from the API response
       const paymentResult = response.data;
       
       return paymentResult;
     } catch (error) {
       // Handle any errors that occurred during the API request
       throw new Error('Payment processing failed');
     }
   }
   ```

7. **Handle payment callbacks**: Configure a callback route in your server-side code to handle payment callbacks from the payment gateway. This route will be used by the payment gateway to notify your server about the status of the payment transaction.

   ```javascript
   // Example callback route setup using Express.js (Node.js)
   router.post('/payment/callback', (req, res) => {
     try {
       // Retrieve payment callback data from the request body
       const callbackData = req.body;
       
       // Process the payment callback and perform necessary actions
       //

 (e.g., update payment status in your database)
       paymentGateway.handleCallback(callbackData);
       
       // Send a success response back to the payment gateway
       res.sendStatus(200);
     } catch (error) {
       // Handle any errors that occurred during payment callback processing
       res.sendStatus(500);
     }
   });
   ```

8. **Test the server-side integration**: Use test or sandbox credentials provided by the payment gateway to test the server-side integration. Perform payment transactions and simulate callback requests to ensure that the server-side code correctly processes payments and handles callbacks.

9. **Handle error scenarios**: Implement error handling for potential issues during the server-side payment integration. This includes handling network errors, validation errors, and error responses from the payment gateway's API. Properly handle and log any errors that occur to ensure smooth payment processing and troubleshooting.

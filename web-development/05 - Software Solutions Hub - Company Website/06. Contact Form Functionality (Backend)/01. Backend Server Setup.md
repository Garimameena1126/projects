# Setting Up a Backend Server with Node.js and Express

In this task, we will set up a backend server using Node.js and the Express framework. The backend server will handle form submissions from the contact form on our website. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task:

## Step 1: Initialize the Project

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:
```shell
npm init -y
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Install the Express framework and other required dependencies by running the following command:
```shell
npm install express
```

## Step 3: Create the Server File

1. Create a new file named `server.js` in the project directory.
2. Open `server.js` in a text editor.

## Step 4: Import Dependencies and Set Up Express

1. In `server.js`, require the Express module and create an instance of the Express application. Add the following code snippet at the beginning of the file:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

## Step 5: Define Routes

1. Define a route for handling form submissions. For example, to handle POST requests to `/submit-form`, add the following code snippet after the previous step:
```javascript
app.post('/submit-form', (req, res) => {
  // Handle form submission logic
});
```

## Step 6: Implement Middleware

1. Implement middleware to parse JSON and URL-encoded form data. Add the following code snippet before the route definition:
```javascript
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

## Step 7: Start the Server

1. Add the following code snippet at the end of the `server.js` file to start the server on a specified port (e.g., 3000):
```javascript
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Step 8: Test the Server

1. Save the changes to `server.js`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Start the server by running the following command:
```shell
node server.js
```
5. Check the terminal output for the "Server is running on port" message, indicating that the server is running.
6. Access the server's routes using an API testing tool like Postman or by submitting the contact form on your website. Note that the route we defined in Step 5 (`/submit-form`) is where the form submissions will be sent.

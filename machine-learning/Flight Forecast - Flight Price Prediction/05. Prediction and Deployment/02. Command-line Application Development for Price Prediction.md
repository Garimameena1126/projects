

## Step 1: Set Up the Project Environment

1. Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, visit the [Python website](https://www.python.org/) and download the latest version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to set up Python on your machine.

2. Create a Project Directory: Create a new directory for your project. You can name it something like "FlightPricePredictionCLI". Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional): It's good practice to use a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named "venv" (you can choose a different name if you prefer):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the Virtual Environment: Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your operating system:

   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   
   - For macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Open your terminal or command prompt with the virtual environment activated.

2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install scikit-learn pandas
   ```

   This command will install scikit-learn and pandas, which are essential libraries for building the machine learning model and handling data.

## Step 3: Load the Trained Model

1. Place your trained machine learning model file in the project directory. Let's assume the file is named "flight_price_model.pkl".

2. In your code editor, create a new Python file called "flight_price_prediction.py" in the project directory.

3. Open "flight_price_prediction.py" and import the necessary libraries:

   ```python
   import pickle
   import pandas as pd
   ```

4. Load the trained model from the file:

   ```python
   def load_model():
       with open("flight_price_model.pkl", "rb") as file:
           model = pickle.load(file)
       return model
   ```

## Step 4: Accept User Input

1. Create a function to accept user input for flight details:

   ```python
   def get_flight_details():
       print("Enter the flight details:")
       departure = input("Departure airport: ")
       arrival = input("Arrival airport: ")
       date = input("Date (YYYY-MM-DD): ")
       airline = input("Airline: ")
       
       # Return the flight details as a dictionary
       return {
           "departure": departure,
           "arrival": arrival,
           "date": date,
           "airline": airline
       }
   ```

## Step 5: Predict Flight Price

1. Create a function to predict the flight price based on user input:

   ```python
   def predict_flight_price(flight_details, model):
       # Create a DataFrame from the flight details
       df = pd.DataFrame([flight_details])
       
       # Perform any necessary data preprocessing or feature engineering on the DataFrame
       # ...
       
       # Make the price prediction using the trained model
       price_prediction = model.predict(df)
       
       # Return the predicted price
       return price_prediction[0]
   ```

## Step 6: Run the Application

1. Add the following code to the bottom of "flight_price_prediction.py" to run the application:

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Load the trained model
       model = load_model()
       
       # Get flight details from the user
       flight_details

 = get_flight_details()
       
       # Predict the flight price
       predicted_price = predict_flight_price(flight_details, model)
       
       # Display the predicted price to the user
       print("Predicted flight price:", predicted_price)
   ```

2. Save the file and close your code editor.

## Step 7: Run the Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

2. Activate the virtual environment (if you're using one).

3. Run the command to execute the application:

   ```
   python flight_price_prediction.py
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter the flight details. After providing the necessary information, the application will display the predicted flight price based on the trained model.

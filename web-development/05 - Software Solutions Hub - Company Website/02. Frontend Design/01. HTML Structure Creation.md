In this task, we will create the HTML structure for our website. This involves defining the necessary sections such as the header, navigation, services, team, portfolio, and footer. Follow the steps below to create the HTML structure:

## Step 1: Open the HTML File

Open your HTML file in your preferred code editor. Make sure you have completed the previous tasks of setting up the project repository, creating the basic folder structure, and initializing the project with necessary dependencies.

## Step 2: Create the Basic Structure

1. Inside the `<body>` tag of your HTML file, create the basic structure of your website. This will include the main sections such as header, navigation, services, team, portfolio, and footer. Use the following code as a starting point:
```html
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Header content goes here -->
    </header>

    <nav>
        <!-- Navigation content goes here -->
    </nav>

    <section id="services">
        <!-- Services section content goes here -->
    </section>

    <section id="team">
        <!-- Team section content goes here -->
    </section>

    <section id="portfolio">
        <!-- Portfolio section content goes here -->
    </section>

    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content goes here -->
    </footer>
</body>
```
2. Replace the `<!-- Header content goes here -->`, `<!-- Navigation content goes here -->`, `<!-- Services section content goes here -->`, `<!-- Team section content goes here -->`, `<!-- Portfolio section content goes here -->`, and `<!-- Footer content goes here -->` placeholders with the actual content for each respective section. 

## Step 3: Add Content to Each Section

1. Replace the `<!-- Header content goes here -->` placeholder with the content for your header section. This may include the website logo, site title, slogan, or any other information you want to display at the top of your website.

2. Replace the `<!-- Navigation content goes here -->` placeholder with the navigation menu for your website. This typically includes links to different pages or sections of your website.

3. Replace the `<!-- Services section content goes here -->` placeholder with the content for your services section. This section can showcase the different services or features your website offers.

4. Replace the `<!-- Team section content goes here -->` placeholder with the content for your team section. This section can introduce your team members, their roles, and their expertise.

5. Replace the `<!-- Portfolio section content goes here -->` placeholder with the content for your portfolio section. This section can showcase your previous work, projects, or products.

6. Replace the `<!-- Footer content goes here -->` placeholder with the content for your footer section. This may include copyright information, contact details, or links to other important pages.

## Step 4: Save and Review

Save the HTML file and open it in a web browser to review the structure you've created. Verify that the sections are displayed correctly and that the content is in the expected locations.

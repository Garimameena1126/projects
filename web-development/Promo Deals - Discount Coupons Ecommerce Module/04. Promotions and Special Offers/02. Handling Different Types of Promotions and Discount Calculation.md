In this guide, we will implement the necessary changes to handle different types of promotions, such as percentage-based discounts, free shipping, buy-one-get-one (BOGO) offers, etc., and calculate the correct discounts in the cart.

### Step 1: Update Coupon Data Structure

1. Open the file where you store the coupon data or create a new file to define the coupon data structure.
2. Add new properties to the coupon object to support different types of promotions. For example, you could include properties like `discountType`, `discountValue`, `freeShipping`, `bogoOffer`, etc.

```javascript
// Example coupon data structure
const coupon = {
  code: "SUMMER20",
  discountType: "percentage",
  discountValue: 20,
  freeShipping: false,
  bogoOffer: false,
};
```

### Step 2: Modify Discount Calculation Logic

1. Locate the code that calculates the discount amount in the cart.
2. Update the code to consider the promotion type and apply the corresponding calculation logic.

```javascript
function calculateDiscountedAmount(coupon, totalAmount) {
  let discountedAmount = totalAmount;

  if (coupon.discountType === "percentage") {
    const discountPercentage = coupon.discountValue / 100;
    discountedAmount -= totalAmount * discountPercentage;
  } else if (coupon.discountType === "freeShipping") {
    // Apply free shipping logic
    // ...
  } else if (coupon.discountType === "bogoOffer") {
    // Apply BOGO offer logic
    // ...
  }

  return discountedAmount;
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Promotion-Specific Logic

1. For each type of promotion, you need to implement the specific logic to calculate the discount or apply the offer.
2. Add conditional statements or separate functions to handle each promotion type.

```javascript
function calculateDiscountedAmount(coupon, totalAmount) {
  let discountedAmount = totalAmount;

  if (coupon.discountType === "percentage") {
    const discountPercentage = coupon.discountValue / 100;
    discountedAmount -= totalAmount * discountPercentage;
  } else if (coupon.discountType === "freeShipping") {
    // Apply free shipping logic
    discountedAmount += coupon.freeShipping ? 0 : calculateShippingCost();
  } else if (coupon.discountType === "bogoOffer") {
    // Apply BOGO offer logic
    discountedAmount = applyBogoOffer(discountedAmount, coupon.bogoOffer);
  }

  return discountedAmount;
}
```

### Step 4: Implement Promotion-Specific Helper Functions (Optional)

1. If required, implement additional helper functions to handle specific promotion calculations.
2. These functions can be used within the main `calculateDiscountedAmount` function or separately, depending on your code structure.

```javascript
function calculateShippingCost() {
  // Calculate the shipping cost based on the user's location, package weight, etc.
  // ...
  return shippingCost;
}

function applyBogoOffer(totalAmount, bogoOffer) {
  // Apply the BOGO offer logic
  // ...
  return discountedAmount;
}
```

### Step 5: Update Cart Calculation Logic

1. Locate the code that calculates the total amount in the cart.
2. Modify the code to use the updated `calculateDiscountedAmount` function and pass the coupon object and the cart's total amount to calculate the discounted amount.

```javascript
function calculateCartTotal(cartItems, coupon) {
  let totalAmount = 0;

 

 // Calculate the total amount based on the cart items

  const discountedAmount = calculateDiscountedAmount(coupon, totalAmount);

  return discountedAmount;
}
```

# Step-by-Step Guide: Implementing Basic Validation for Exercise Logging Form

In this task, we will add basic validation to the exercise logging form to ensure that all fields are filled before submitting the form. This validation will help improve the user experience and ensure accurate data entry. Follow the step-by-step guide below to implement this feature.

## Prerequisites

- HTML knowledge
- JavaScript basics
- Code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed

## Steps

1. **Open Code Editor**

   Launch your preferred code editor or IDE.

2. **Open the HTML File**

   Open the `index.html` file that contains the exercise logging form in your code editor.

3. **Add `required` Attribute**

   Locate each input field in the form (exercise name, sets, and reps) and add the `required` attribute to each input tag. This attribute ensures that the field must be filled before the form can be submitted.

   ```html
   <input type="text" id="exercise-name" name="exercise-name" required>
   <input type="number" id="sets" name="sets" required>
   <input type="number" id="reps" name="reps" required>
   ```

4. **Create JavaScript Validation Function**

   Add a `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag in your HTML file to include JavaScript code. Inside the `<script>` tag, create a validation function that will be triggered when the form is submitted.

   ```html
   <script>
     function validateForm() {
       // Add validation logic here
     }
   </script>
   ```

5. **Implement Validation Logic**

   Within the `validateForm()` function, retrieve the values entered in the input fields using their respective `id` attributes. Then, check if any of the fields are empty. If any field is empty, display an error message and prevent the form from being submitted.

   ```html
   <script>
     function validateForm() {
       const exerciseName = document.getElementById('exercise-name').value;
       const sets = document.getElementById('sets').value;
       const reps = document.getElementById('reps').value;

       if (exerciseName === '' || sets === '' || reps === '') {
         alert('Please fill in all fields.');
         return false; // Prevent form submission
       }
     }
   </script>
   ```

   In this example, an alert message is displayed if any of the fields are empty. You can customize the error message or implement alternative ways to indicate the validation error.

6. **Update the Form Element**

   In the `<form>` element, add the `onsubmit` attribute and set it to the name of the validation function (`validateForm()` in this case).

   ```html
   <form onsubmit="return validateForm()">
     <!-- Form content -->
   </form>
   ```

   This attribute ensures that the validation function is called when the form is submitted. The `return` statement ensures that the form submission is prevented if the validation fails.

7. **Test the Form**

   Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Enter some values in the exercise logging form and try submitting the form without filling in all the fields. You should see the validation error message alerting you to fill in all the fields.

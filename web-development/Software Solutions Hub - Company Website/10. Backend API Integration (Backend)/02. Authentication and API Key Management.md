# Setting Up Authentication and API Key Management

In this task, we will focus on setting up the necessary authentication and API key management for integrating a third-party API into your project. By following this guide, you will be able to securely manage your API key and authenticate your requests to the API. Let's proceed with the step-by-step instructions.

## Step 1: Choose an API Key Management Method

1. Determine the most suitable method for managing your API keys. There are several options available, including environment variables, configuration files, key management services, or a combination of these approaches.

2. Consider the security requirements and best practices specific to your backend technology stack. Consult the documentation or community resources for recommendations and examples.

## Step 2: Create a Configuration File or Module

1. Create a configuration file or module in your backend codebase to store your API keys and other sensitive information. This file/module should not be exposed publicly.

2. If using a configuration file, ensure it is properly secured and not accessible via version control systems. If using a module, make sure it is imported and used only where necessary.

3. Define a variable in the configuration file/module to store the API key. For example, in JavaScript, you can use:

   ```javascript
   // config.js
   module.exports = {
     apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
   };
   ```

## Step 3: Retrieve API Key in Backend Code

1. Import or access the configuration file/module where the API key is stored.

2. Use the appropriate method to retrieve the API key in your backend code. For example, in JavaScript:

   ```javascript
   const config = require('./config');
   const apiKey = config.apiKey;
   ```

   In this example, `config` is the imported configuration file/module, and `apiKey` is the variable storing the API key.

## Step 4: Include API Key in API Requests

1. Review the API documentation to determine how to include the API key in your requests. This could be as a query parameter, in the request headers, or as part of the request body.

2. Modify your API request code to include the API key in the appropriate location. Consult the documentation or examples provided by the API provider for the correct method. For example, in JavaScript using the `axios` library:

   ```javascript
   const axios = require('axios');

   // Make a GET request with the API key included as a query parameter
   axios.get('https://api.example.com/endpoint', {
     params: {
       apiKey: apiKey,
     },
   })
   .then((response) => {
     // Handle the response data
   })
   .catch((error) => {
     // Handle any errors
   });
   ```

   In this example, `apiKey` is the variable storing the retrieved API key.

## Step 5: Test API Authentication

1. Create a test endpoint or use an existing one to verify that your API key is properly authenticated.

2. Make a test API request to the chosen endpoint and confirm that you receive the expected response. This will validate that the authentication and API key management are functioning correctly.

## Step 6: Secure Your API Key

1. Ensure that your API key is securely stored and not exposed in publicly accessible files or repositories.

2. If using environment variables, double-check that they are correctly set and not shared in source code repositories.

3. Regularly review and update your security practices, including rotating API keys when necessary, to maintain the security of your project.

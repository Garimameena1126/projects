Follow the steps below to implement access restriction functionality for authenticated users:

## Step 1: Set up Firebase

1. Create a Firebase project by going to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and signing in with your Google account.
2. Click on "Add project" or select an existing project.
3. Follow the prompts to create a new Firebase project.

## Step 2: Enable Firebase Authentication

1. In the Firebase Console, select your project.
2. Click on "Authentication" in the left sidebar.
3. Go to the "Sign-in method" tab.
4. Choose the authentication providers you want to enable (e.g., Email/Password, Google, etc.).
5. Follow the instructions to configure each authentication provider.

## Step 3: Include Firebase SDK in Your Website

1. Open your HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in a text editor or IDE.
2. Include the Firebase SDK by adding the following script tag to the head of your HTML file:

    ```html
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.0.2/firebase-app.js"></script>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.0.2/firebase-auth.js"></script>
    ```

## Step 4: Initialize Firebase in Your JavaScript Code

1. Open your JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) in a text editor or IDE.
2. Initialize Firebase in your JavaScript code by adding the following code:

    ```javascript
    // Replace the configuration object with your own Firebase configuration
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      // ...other configuration properties
    };
    
    // Initialize Firebase
    firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    ```

## Step 5: Check User Authentication Status

1. In your JavaScript code, add a function to check the user's authentication status.
2. Use the Firebase Authentication API to detect if a user is currently logged in or not.

    Here's an example of JavaScript code to check the user's authentication status using Firebase Authentication:

    ```javascript
    // Function to check user authentication status
    const checkAuthStatus = () => {
      firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
        if (user) {
          // User is authenticated, perform authorized actions
          console.log("User is logged in:", user);
          // Show restricted sections or features for authenticated users
          document.getElementById("restricted-section").style.display = "block";
        } else {
          // User is not authenticated, perform unauthorized actions
          console.log("User is not logged in");
          // Hide restricted sections or features for unauthorized users
          document.getElementById("restricted-section").style.display = "none";
        }
      });
    };
    
    // Call the checkAuthStatus function when the page loads
    window.addEventListener("load", checkAuthStatus);
    ```

## Step 6: Update HTML and CSS

1. Modify your HTML file to include the restricted sections or features that should only be visible to authenticated users.
2. Add an `id` attribute to the HTML elements that represent the restricted sections or features.
3. Update your CSS file to define the styles for the restricted sections or features, including hiding them initially.

    ```html
    <!-- Example of restricted section -->
    <div id="restricted-section">
      <h2>Restricted Section</h2>
      <p>This section is only visible to authenticated users.</p>
    </div>
    ```
    
    ```css
    /* Example CSS styles for restricted section */
    #
    
    restricted-section {
      display: none; /* Hide the section by default */
      /* Add your desired styles here */
    }
    ```

## Step 7: Test and Refine

1. Preview your website in a web browser.
2. Test the access restriction functionality by signing in with an authenticated user and checking if the restricted sections or features are visible.
3. Sign out and verify that the restricted sections or features are hidden for unauthorized users.
4. Handle any edge cases or error scenarios related to access restriction.
5. Refine the user interface and error handling as needed.

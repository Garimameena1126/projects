# Module 9: Real-time Sentiment Analysis

## Task: Implement mechanisms for handling high-throughput data and ensuring efficient processing

In this task, we will enhance the sentiment analysis API to handle real-time streaming customer support messages efficiently. We'll explore techniques such as batch processing and message queuing to optimize the sentiment analysis workflow. By implementing mechanisms for handling high-throughput data, we can ensure efficient processing of incoming messages and improve the responsiveness of the system.

To accomplish this task, we will perform the following steps:

1. **Setting up a message queue**
2. **Configuring a worker process**
3. **Processing messages from the queue**
4. **Enhancing the API for real-time sentiment analysis**
5. **Testing the real-time sentiment analysis functionality**

Let's proceed with each step in detail.

## Step 1: Setting up a message queue

To handle high-throughput data efficiently, we will use a message queue system. In this guide, we will use RabbitMQ as an example message broker, but you can choose a different message queue system according to your preference.

1. Install RabbitMQ by following the installation instructions provided in the [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html).

2. Start the RabbitMQ server by running the following command:
```bash
rabbitmq-server
```

3. Once the server is running, you can access the RabbitMQ management interface by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:15672`. Log in with the default credentials (username: `guest`, password: `guest`).

4. Create a new queue by clicking on the "Queues" tab and then selecting "Add a new queue". Provide a name for the queue, such as `sentiment-analysis-queue`, and click "Add queue" to create it.

Congratulations! You have now set up a message queue using RabbitMQ.

## Step 2: Configuring a worker process

In order to process messages from the message queue, we need to configure a worker process that will continuously monitor the queue and perform sentiment analysis on incoming messages.

1. Create a new Python file, e.g., `worker.py`, and import the necessary dependencies:
```python
import pika
import json
from your_sentiment_analysis_module import analyze_sentiment  # Replace with your actual sentiment analysis module
```

2. Establish a connection with RabbitMQ and create a channel:
```python
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()
```

3. Declare the queue that will be used for message consumption:
```python
queue_name = 'sentiment-analysis-queue'
channel.queue_declare(queue=queue_name)
```

4. Define a callback function to process incoming messages:
```python
def process_message(ch, method, properties, body):
    # Parse the message body as JSON
    message = json.loads(body)

    # Extract the customer support message text
    text = message['text']

    # Perform sentiment analysis on the message
    sentiment = analyze_sentiment(text)  # Replace with your actual sentiment analysis function

    # Process the sentiment result (e.g., store it in a database, send it to another system)
    # ...
    
    # Acknowledge the message to remove it from the queue
    channel.basic_ack(delivery_tag=method.delivery_tag)
```

5. Set up the worker process to consume messages from the queue:
```python
channel.basic_consume(queue=queue_name, on_message_callback=process_message)

# Start consuming messages
channel.start_consuming()
```

Great! You have configured the worker process to consume messages from the message queue.

## Step 3: Processing messages from the queue

To test the worker

 process and ensure that messages are being processed correctly, we can publish sample messages to the queue.

1. In a separate Python script or interactive console, import the necessary dependencies and establish a connection with RabbitMQ:
```python
import pika

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()
```

2. Declare the same queue that the worker process is consuming from:
```python
queue_name = 'sentiment-analysis-queue'
channel.queue_declare(queue=queue_name)
```

3. Publish sample messages to the queue:
```python
messages = [
    {'text': 'I love your product! It works perfectly.'},
    {'text': 'I'm having trouble with your service. It's very frustrating.'},
    # Add more sample messages as needed
]

for message in messages:
    channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key=queue_name, body=json.dumps(message))
```

4. After publishing the messages, you should see the worker process in the other Python script (i.e., `worker.py`) consuming the messages and performing sentiment analysis on them.

Congratulations! You have successfully processed messages from the queue using a worker process.

## Step 4: Enhancing the API for real-time sentiment analysis

Now that we have the worker process set up to handle incoming messages, we need to enhance the sentiment analysis API to integrate with the message queue and provide real-time sentiment analysis functionality.

1. Update the API endpoint for submitting customer support messages to publish messages to the queue instead of directly performing sentiment analysis:
```python
import pika
import json

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()

queue_name = 'sentiment-analysis-queue'
channel.queue_declare(queue=queue_name)

@app.route('/api/submit-message', methods=['POST'])
def submit_message():
    # Extract the customer support message from the request
    message = request.json['message']

    # Publish the message to the queue
    channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key=queue_name, body=json.dumps({'text': message}))

    return 'Message submitted for analysis'
```

2. Make sure to import the necessary dependencies and establish the connection with RabbitMQ at the beginning of your API script:
```python
from flask import Flask, request
import pika
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

# Establish connection with RabbitMQ
connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()

# ... rest of your API code
```

Well done! You have enhanced the API to handle real-time sentiment analysis by integrating with the message queue.

## Step 5: Testing the real-time sentiment analysis functionality

To test the real-time sentiment analysis functionality, we can submit sample customer support messages through the API and observe the sentiment analysis results.

1. Start the Flask development server by running the API script.

2. Use a tool like cURL or Postman to send HTTP POST requests to the API endpoint `/api/submit-message` with sample customer support messages as the request payload.

3. After submitting the messages, you can check the worker process logs to see the sentiment analysis results for each message.

By following these steps, you have successfully tested the real-time sentiment analysis functionality of the API.

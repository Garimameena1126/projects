# Creating a New Project Folder and Initializing a Git Repository

In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating a new project folder and initializing a Git repository for your fitness class booking system web development project. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org) if you haven't already.
- Git: Install Git by following the instructions provided on the official Git website (https://git-scm.com).

## Step 1: Create a New Project Folder
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project folder. For example, if you want to create the project folder on your desktop, use the following command:
    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    ```
3. Create a new folder for your project by running the following command:
    ```bash
    mkdir fitness-class-booking-system
    ```
   Replace "fitness-class-booking-system" with the desired name for your project.

## Step 2: Initialize a Git Repository
1. Change into the newly created project folder using the following command:
    ```bash
    cd fitness-class-booking-system
    ```
2. Initialize a new Git repository in the project folder by executing the following command:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
   This command initializes an empty Git repository in the current directory.

3. Verify that the Git repository has been successfully initialized by checking for the presence of a hidden `.git` folder. Use the following command to display all files and folders, including hidden ones:
    ```bash
    ls -a
    ```
   Ensure that you see the `.git` folder listed.

4. Set up your initial Git configuration by providing your name and email address. This information will be associated with your Git commits. Use the following commands, replacing "Your Name" and "your@email.com" with your actual name and email:
    ```bash
    git config user.name "Your Name"
    git config user.email "your@email.com"
    ```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new project folder and initialized a Git repository. The next step is to set up the project structure and configure the necessary files.

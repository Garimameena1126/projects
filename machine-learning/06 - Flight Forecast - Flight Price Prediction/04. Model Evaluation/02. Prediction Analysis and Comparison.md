# Analyzing Model Predictions and Comparing to Actual Flight Prices

In this task, we will analyze the predictions made by our trained machine learning model and compare them to the actual flight prices. This step is crucial in evaluating the performance of our model and gaining insights into its accuracy. We will use appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the prediction accuracy.

Let's get started with the step-by-step guide:

## Step 1: Load the Trained Model and Test Data

Before analyzing the predictions, we need to load the trained model and the test data that we split earlier. Make sure you have the trained model file (e.g., `model.pkl`) and the test data file (e.g., `test_data.csv`) available.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pickle

# Load the trained model
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

# Load the test data
test_data = pd.read_csv('test_data.csv')
```

## Step 2: Make Predictions using the Test Data

Using the loaded model, we will make predictions on the test data. This will give us the predicted flight prices, which we can later compare with the actual prices.

```python
# Extract the features from the test data
test_features = test_data.drop('price', axis=1)

# Make predictions using the trained model
predicted_prices = model.predict(test_features)
```

## Step 3: Compare Predictions with Actual Flight Prices

Now that we have the predicted flight prices, we can compare them with the actual prices from the test data. This will allow us to assess how well our model performs in predicting flight prices.

```python
# Extract the actual flight prices from the test data
actual_prices = test_data['price']

# Create a DataFrame to compare the predictions and actual prices
comparison_df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual Prices': actual_prices, 'Predicted Prices': predicted_prices})
```

## Step 4: Calculate Evaluation Metrics

To quantitatively evaluate the performance of our model, we can calculate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics will provide insights into the average prediction error and the overall accuracy of our model.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

# Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
mae = mean_absolute_error(actual_prices, predicted_prices)

# Calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
rmse = mean_squared_error(actual_prices, predicted_prices, squared=False)

print('Mean Absolute Error (MAE):', mae)
print('Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):', rmse)
```

## Step 5: Visualize Predictions and Actual Prices

Visualizing the predicted prices alongside the actual prices can provide a more intuitive understanding of how well our model performs. We can create various plots or charts to compare the two sets of prices.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot a scatter plot of predicted prices versus actual prices
plt.scatter(actual_prices, predicted_prices)
plt.xlabel('Actual Prices')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Prices')
plt.title('Comparison of Actual Prices vs. Predicted Prices')
plt.show()
```

## Step 6: Interpret the Results

After analyzing the model predictions and comparing them to the actual flight prices, it's important to interpret the results and draw conclusions. Consider the following questions:

- How close are the predicted prices to the actual prices?
- Are there any noticeable patterns or trends in the prediction errors?
- Did the evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE) indicate good accuracy?

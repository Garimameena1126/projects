# Create API Endpoints for Retrieving and Storing Exercise Data

In this task, we will create API endpoints for retrieving and storing exercise data. These endpoints will allow the frontend to communicate with the backend server and perform operations such as fetching existing exercises and adding new exercises. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Prerequisites

- Backend server set up using a web framework (e.g., Node.js with Express)

## Steps

1. **Create a New Route for Fetching Exercises**

   Open the entry point file of your backend server (e.g., `server.js`) in your code editor.

2. **Define a GET Route for Fetching Exercises**

   Add the following code to create a new route that handles `GET` requests for fetching exercises:

   ```javascript
   app.get('/exercises', (req, res) => {
     // Logic to retrieve exercises from the database
     // Send the retrieved exercises as the response
   });
   ```

   In this code, we define a `GET` route with the path `/exercises`. When this route is accessed, the server will execute the callback function, which should include the logic to retrieve exercises from the database. We will implement the database integration in a later task.

3. **Retrieve Exercises from the Database**

   Replace the comment in the route handler with code to retrieve exercises from the database. The specific implementation will depend on the database you choose. For example, if you are using MongoDB with the Mongoose library, you can use the following code:

   ```javascript
   const Exercise = require('./models/exercise');

   app.get('/exercises', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const exercises = await Exercise.find();
       res.json(exercises);
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve exercises' });
     }
   });
   ```

   In this code, we import the `Exercise` model from a file called `exercise.js` located in the `models` directory. We then use the `find()` method to retrieve all exercises from the database and send them as a JSON response using the `json()` method.

4. **Create a New Route for Storing Exercises**

   Add the following code to create a new route that handles `POST` requests for storing exercises:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/exercises', (req, res) => {
     // Logic to store the exercise data in the database
     // Send a success or error response
   });
   ```

   In this code, we define a `POST` route with the path `/exercises`. When this route is accessed, the server will execute the callback function, which should include the logic to store the exercise data in the database.

5. **Store Exercise Data in the Database**

   Replace the comment in the route handler with code to store the exercise data in the database. Again, the implementation will depend on your chosen database. Using MongoDB and Mongoose, you can use the following code:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/exercises', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const { name, duration, calories } = req.body;
       const exercise = new Exercise({ name, duration, calories });
       await exercise.save();
       res.status(201).json({ message: 'Exercise saved successfully' });
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to save exercise' });
     }
   });
   ```

   In this code, we extract the exercise data from the request body and create a new instance of the `Exercise` model. We then save the exercise to the database using the `save()` method and send a success response with a status code of 201 (Created) and a JSON message.

6. **Test the API Endpoints**

   Restart your backend server if necessary. You can use tools such as Postman or curl to test the API endpoints.

   - To test the `GET /exercises` endpoint, send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/exercises`. Verify that you receive a response containing the list of exercises.

   - To test the `POST /exercises` endpoint, send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/exercises` with a JSON payload containing the exercise data. For example:

     ```json
     {
       "name": "Push-ups",
       "duration": 10,
       "calories": 50
     }
     ```

     Verify that you receive a success response indicating that the exercise was saved.

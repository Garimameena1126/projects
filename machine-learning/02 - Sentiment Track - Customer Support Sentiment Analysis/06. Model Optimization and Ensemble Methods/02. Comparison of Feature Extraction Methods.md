# Experimenting with Different Feature Extraction Methods for Sentiment Analysis

In this guide, we will explore different feature extraction methods for sentiment analysis. Feature extraction plays a crucial role in machine learning models as it transforms raw input data into a format that can be understood and utilized by the algorithms. We will specifically focus on word embeddings as a feature extraction technique and compare their impact on model accuracy. Word embeddings capture the semantic relationships between words and can improve the performance of sentiment analysis models.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Python installed on your system.
2. The necessary libraries and frameworks, including scikit-learn, NLTK, and TensorFlow or Keras, installed. You can use pip to install these dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install scikit-learn nltk tensorflow
   ```

3. A labeled dataset of customer support messages with sentiment labels. If you don't have one, you can create your own or find publicly available datasets online.

Let's get started with the step-by-step guide:

## Step 1: Load and Preprocess the Dataset
The first step is to load the labeled dataset of customer support messages. Ensure that the dataset contains both the text messages and their corresponding sentiment labels.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('customer_support_dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())
```

Once you have loaded the dataset, you may need to preprocess the text data. The preprocessing steps might include removing unnecessary characters, converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, and performing stemming or lemmatization. The specific preprocessing steps can vary depending on the dataset and your requirements.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

nltk.download('stopwords')

# Preprocess the text data
stopwords = set(stopwords.words('english'))
stemmer = PorterStemmer()

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Remove unnecessary characters
    text = text.strip()
    # Convert text to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    # Remove stop words
    text = ' '.join(word for word in text.split() if word not in stopwords)
    # Perform stemming
    text = ' '.join(stemmer.stem(word) for word in text.split())
    
    return text

# Apply preprocessing to the text column
df['preprocessed_text'] = df['text'].apply(preprocess_text)

# Display the preprocessed data
print(df.head())
```

## Step 2: Split the Dataset into Training and Testing Sets
To evaluate the impact of different feature extraction methods, it's important to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the sentiment analysis models, while the testing set will be used to evaluate their performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['preprocessed_text'], df['sentiment'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Display the shapes of the training and testing sets
print("Training set shape:", X_train.shape)
print("Testing set shape:", X_test.shape)
```

## Step 3: Extract Word Embeddings
Word embeddings represent words in a high-dimensional space, capturing their semantic relationships. We can use pre-trained word embeddings or learn them from scratch. In this guide, we will use the popular pre-trained word embedding model called Word2Vec.

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

# Train Word2Vec model
word2vec_model = Word

2Vec(X_train, size=100, window=5, min_count=1)

# Get word embeddings for the training and testing sets
X_train_embeddings = [word2vec_model.wv[word] for word in X_train]
X_test_embeddings = [word2vec_model.wv[word] for word in X_test]

# Display the dimensions of the word embeddings
print("Word Embeddings shape (Training set):", len(X_train_embeddings), X_train_embeddings[0].shape)
print("Word Embeddings shape (Testing set):", len(X_test_embeddings), X_test_embeddings[0].shape)
```

## Step 4: Train and Evaluate Sentiment Analysis Models
With the word embeddings obtained from the previous step, we can now train and evaluate different sentiment analysis models. We will use a simple logistic regression model as an example.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Train logistic regression model on the training set
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_embeddings, y_train)

# Predict sentiment labels for the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_embeddings)

# Evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

## Step 5: Compare Model Performances
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for different feature extraction methods or word embeddings models. Compare the performance of each model based on the evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to determine which method yields the best results for sentiment analysis.

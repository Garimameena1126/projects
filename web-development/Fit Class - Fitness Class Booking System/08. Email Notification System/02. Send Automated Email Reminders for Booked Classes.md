# Sending Automated Email Reminders to Users

In this guide, we will walk through the process of integrating an email service provider into your fitness class booking system project and sending automated email reminders to users before their booked classes. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to implement this functionality.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- An email service provider account (e.g., SendGrid, Nodemailer).
- The necessary credentials and configuration details from your email service provider.

## Step 1: Set Up the Email Service Provider
1. Sign up for an account with your chosen email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Nodemailer).
2. Obtain the necessary credentials or API keys to authenticate your requests to the email service provider. This typically involves generating an API key or obtaining SMTP server credentials.

## Step 2: Install Required Packages
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Install the appropriate package for integrating with your email service provider. For example, if you are using Nodemailer, run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install nodemailer
    ```

## Step 3: Set Up Email Configuration
1. Create a new file named `emailConfig.js` in your project directory.
2. Open `emailConfig.js` in a text editor and add the following code:
    ```javascript
    const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
    
    // Create a transporter with your email service provider's configuration
    const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
      // Provide the configuration details obtained from your email service provider
      // For example, if using SendGrid, you may need to provide an API key or SMTP server details
      service: 'your_email_service_provider',
      auth: {
        user: 'your_email_username',
        pass: 'your_email_password',
      },
    });
    
    module.exports = transporter;
    ```
   Replace `'your_email_service_provider'`, `'your_email_username'`, and `'your_email_password'` with the appropriate values from your email service provider.

## Step 4: Implement Email Sending Functionality
1. Open the file where you handle class bookings or reservations.
2. Locate the code that handles successful class bookings and find the point where you want to send the email reminders. This might be in a function like `bookClass()` or `handleReservation()`.
3. Import the `transporter` from the `emailConfig.js` file at the top of the file. For example:
    ```javascript
    const transporter = require('./emailConfig');
    ```
   Adjust the path if necessary depending on the file structure of your project.

4. Within the appropriate function, add the code to send the email reminder. Here's an example using Nodemailer:
    ```javascript
    // Send email reminder to the user
    const sendEmailReminder = (userEmail, className, date) => {
      const mailOptions = {
        from: 'your_email@example.com', // Replace with your desired sender email
        to: userEmail,
        subject: 'Class Reminder',
        text: `This is a reminder that you have booked the ${className} class on ${date}.`
      };
    
      transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
        if (error) {
          console.error('Error sending email:', error);
        } else {
          console.log('Email sent:', info.response);
        }
      });
    };
    ```
   Customize the email content and subject as desired.

5. Call the `sendEmailReminder()` function at the appropriate point in your code, passing in the user's email, class name, and date as arguments. For example:
    ```javascript
    sendEmailReminder(userEmail, className, classDate);
    ```
   Replace`userEmail`, `className`, and `classDate` with the appropriate variables from your code.

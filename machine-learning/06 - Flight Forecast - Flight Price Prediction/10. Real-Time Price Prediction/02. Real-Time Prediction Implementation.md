In this task, we will implement a data retrieval mechanism to fetch the latest flight details from an API. We will then use the trained model to predict the current prices based on the fetched data.

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

First, let's import the necessary libraries for this task. We will be using the `requests` library to make API requests and retrieve data.

```python
import requests
```

### Step 2: Define API Endpoint and Parameters

Next, we need to define the API endpoint and any required parameters to fetch the flight details. Consult the API documentation to understand the endpoint structure and the parameters it expects.

```python
api_endpoint = "https://api.example.com/flights"
parameters = {
    "origin": "JFK",
    "destination": "LAX",
    "date": "2023-06-30"
}
```

Make sure to replace the `api_endpoint` with the actual URL of the flight data API you are using. Modify the `parameters` dictionary according to the required parameters for your specific API.

### Step 3: Send API Request and Retrieve Data

Now, we will send an API request to fetch the flight details based on the defined endpoint and parameters. We will handle any errors that may occur during the request and retrieve the response data.

```python
try:
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, params=parameters)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception if the request was unsuccessful
    flight_data = response.json()  # Extract the response data in JSON format
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print("Error occurred during API request:", str(e))
    # Handle the error appropriately (e.g., retry the request, terminate the program)
```

The `response` object contains the API response, and we extract the JSON data using the `json()` method. We also use the `raise_for_status()` method to raise an exception if the request was unsuccessful (e.g., status code >= 400).

### Step 4: Preprocess the Retrieved Data

Once we have retrieved the flight data from the API, we need to preprocess it before using it for prediction. Perform the necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling, just as we did in the data preprocessing module.

```python
# Preprocess the retrieved flight data
# Perform any necessary data cleaning, encoding, and scaling
preprocessed_data = preprocess_flight_data(flight_data)
```

The `preprocess_flight_data()` function is a placeholder that represents your specific preprocessing pipeline. Replace it with your actual data preprocessing code.

### Step 5: Use Trained Model for Prediction

Finally, we can use our trained machine learning model to make predictions based on the preprocessed flight data.

```python
predicted_prices = trained_model.predict(preprocessed_data)
```

Assuming you have already trained a model using the previous modules, the `trained_model` object represents your trained machine learning model. Make sure to replace it with your actual model object.

### Step 6: Display the Predicted Prices

To provide the real-time flight price predictions to the user, we can simply display the predicted prices in a user-friendly format.

```python
for predicted_price in predicted_prices:
    print("Predicted Price:", predicted_price)
```

This code snippet will iterate over the predicted prices and print them one by one. You can modify the code to suit your specific needs, such as formatting the output or integrating it with a user interface.

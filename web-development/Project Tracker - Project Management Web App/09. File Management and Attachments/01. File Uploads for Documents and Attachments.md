In this guide, we will explore how to enable file uploads in your project for storing project-related documents and attachments. Users will be able to upload files from their devices and associate them with specific projects or tasks.

## Step 1: Set Up the Server-Side Environment

1. Ensure that you have a server-side environment set up for your project. This can be a backend framework like Node.js with Express, Django, Ruby on Rails, or any other server-side technology of your choice.
2. Install any necessary dependencies or libraries for handling file uploads in your chosen server-side environment.

## Step 2: Create an Upload Form

1. Design a user interface component that allows users to select and upload files. This can be an HTML form with an input field of type "file".
2. Add the necessary HTML markup to create the upload form. Here's an example:

```html
<form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="file" />
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

## Step 3: Handle File Uploads on the Server-Side

1. Set up a server-side route or endpoint that will handle the file uploads. This route should correspond to the `action` attribute in the upload form.
2. Implement the logic to handle the file upload in your server-side code. Here's an example using Node.js with Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');

const app = express();
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' }); // Set the destination folder for uploaded files

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  // Access the uploaded file using req.file
  const uploadedFile = req.file;
  // Process the file as needed (e.g., save it to a database, associate it with a project or task)

  // Return a response to the client
  res.json({ message: 'File uploaded successfully' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

## Step 4: Handle File Validation

1. Implement server-side validation to ensure that only allowed file types and sizes are accepted.
2. Check the file type and size before processing the uploaded file. You can use libraries or built-in functions to perform these validations.
3. If the uploaded file does not meet the specified criteria, return an appropriate error response to the client.

## Step 5: Store Uploaded Files

1. Decide where you want to store the uploaded files. This can be a secure location on your server or a cloud storage service like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Dropbox.
2. Configure your server-side code to store the uploaded files in the chosen location.
3. Implement the necessary logic to manage file storage, including generating unique file names, handling file conflicts, and organizing files based on projects or tasks.

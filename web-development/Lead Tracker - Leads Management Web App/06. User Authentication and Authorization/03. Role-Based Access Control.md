To add role-based access control to your application, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Define Roles

1. Identify the roles you want to implement in your application. For example, you might have roles like "admin," "user," and "guest."
2. Determine the permissions associated with each role. Permissions define what actions or resources each role can access. For instance, an admin might have full access to all features, while a user may have limited access.

#### Step 2: Update User Model

1. Modify your user model to include a field for the user's role. This field can be a string or an enum, depending on your implementation.
2. Update the registration process to capture the user's role during registration.

Example code snippet for a user model in Node.js using Mongoose:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  // Other user fields
  role: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['admin', 'user', 'guest'],
    default: 'user',
  },
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

#### Step 3: Implement Authorization Middleware

1. Create middleware functions to handle authorization checks for different roles. These middleware functions will be executed before processing the requested action.
2. Each middleware function should verify the user's role and determine if they have the necessary permissions to perform the action.
3. If the user is not authorized, the middleware should either redirect them to an error page or return an appropriate error response.

Example code snippet for an authorization middleware function in Node.js using Express:

```javascript
function requireAdmin(req, res, next) {
  if (req.user.role !== 'admin') {
    return res.status(403).send('Access denied.');
  }
  next();
}

function requireUser(req, res, next) {
  if (req.user.role !== 'user') {
    return res.status(403).send('Access denied.');
  }
  next();
}
```

#### Step 4: Apply Middleware to Restricted Routes

1. Identify the routes or actions that require role-based access control.
2. Apply the corresponding middleware function(s) from Step 3 to those routes or actions.
3. When a user attempts to access a restricted route, the middleware will check their role and authorize or deny access accordingly.

Example code snippet for applying middleware to routes in Node.js using Express:

```javascript
// Restricted route accessible only to admins
app.get('/admin/dashboard', requireAdmin, (req, res) => {
  // Handle the admin dashboard logic
});

// Restricted route accessible only to authenticated users
app.get('/user/profile', requireUser, (req, res) => {
  // Handle the user profile logic
});
```

#### Step 5: Update UI Based on User Role

1. Modify your application's UI to display different features or options based on the user's role.
2. Conditionally render or enable/disable UI elements based on the user's role.

Example code snippet for conditionally rendering UI elements in a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Dashboard({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {user.role === 'admin' && (
        <button>Edit Settings</button>
      )}
      {user.role === 'user' && (
        <button>View Profile</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```


## Declare an array variable to store the class names.

1. Open your text editor or IDE.
2. In the project directory, locate the JavaScript folder (you can create one if it doesn't exist).
3. Create a new JavaScript file named "script.js" in the JavaScript folder.
   - For example, in Visual Studio Code, you can go to `File -> New File` and then save the file as "script.js" in the desired location.
4. Open the "script.js" file and link it to the HTML file by adding the following `<script>` tag inside the `<head>` section of your "index.html" file:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Class Schedule</title>
       <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
   </head>
   <body>
       <!-- Rest of your HTML code -->
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   
   Note: Replace `"path/to/script.js"` with the actual path to the "script.js" file. For example, if the "script.js" file is in the same directory as the "index.html" file, you can use `src="script.js"`.

5. Now, in the "script.js" file, declare an array variable to store the class names. Add the following code:

   ```javascript
   // Declare an array to store class names
   var classNames = [];
   ```
   
   Explanation:
   - The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript.
   - `classNames` is the variable name we have chosen for the array that will store the class names.
   - We have initialized the array with empty brackets `[]` to indicate that it's an empty array for now.

6. Save the "script.js" file.

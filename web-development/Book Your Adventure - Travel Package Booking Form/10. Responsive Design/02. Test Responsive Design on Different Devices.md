In this task, we will focus on testing the responsiveness of your website on different devices and screen sizes. Follow the steps below to accomplish this.

1. Prepare Test Environment
   - Ensure that you have access to different devices or emulators to test your website.
   - Prepare a list of target devices and screen sizes you want to test on, such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

2. Test on Physical Devices
   - Use physical devices to test your website's responsiveness.
   - Connect the devices to your development machine or local network.
   - Open your website on each device's browser and observe the layout and behavior.
   - Check if the elements adjust properly, text is readable, and interactions work as intended.

3. Use Browser Developer Tools
   - Most modern browsers provide developer tools that allow you to simulate different devices and screen sizes.
   - Open your website on a desktop browser.
   - Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to open the developer tools.
   - In the developer tools panel, find the device toolbar or device emulation mode.
   - Choose a device from the available options or manually set the desired screen dimensions.
   - Reload the page to view your website as it would appear on the selected device or screen size.
   - Repeat the process for different devices and screen sizes you want to test.

4. Test on Emulators and Simulators
   - If you don't have access to physical devices, you can use emulators or simulators to test your website.
   - Emulators and simulators are software tools that mimic the behavior of real devices.
   - Install a reputable emulator or simulator software compatible with the devices you want to test.
   - Launch the emulator or simulator and follow the instructions to set up the desired device and screen size.
   - Open your website within the emulator or simulator and assess its responsiveness.
   - Pay attention to layout adjustments, font sizes, touch interactions, and overall user experience.

5. Verify Elements and Interactions
   - While testing, carefully examine the elements and interactions on your website.
   - Check if all elements are correctly positioned, resized, or hidden based on screen size.
   - Ensure that text remains readable without excessive zooming or horizontal scrolling.
   - Test interactive elements like buttons, forms, and menus to verify their functionality.
   - Verify that touch-friendly interactions work well on mobile devices.

6. Iterate and Refine
   - Take note of any issues or inconsistencies discovered during testing.
   - Make adjustments to your CSS styles, media queries, or other responsive design techniques as needed.
   - Repeat the testing process to validate the changes and ensure improved responsiveness.
   - Continue iterating and refining your design until you are satisfied with the responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

Example Code Snippet:
```html
<!-- Sample code for a responsive image -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Responsive Image" class="responsive-image">

<!-- CSS styles for responsive image -->
<style>


## Build a Basic Layout Using HTML and CSS

To create a visually appealing and functional user interface for your lead management system, you need to build a basic layout using HTML and CSS. This guide will walk you through the process:

### Step 1: Open the HTML File

Ensure that you have already created the HTML file for your lead management system, as outlined in the previous task. Open the HTML file in your preferred text editor.

### Step 2: Set Up the HTML Structure

Inside the `<body>` section of your HTML file, you will begin building the layout using HTML and CSS. Start by creating a container element that will hold the main content of your lead management system.

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <!-- Your HTML code goes here -->
  </div>
</body>
```

### Step 3: Create Sections and Elements

Within the container element, you can create different sections and elements to structure your layout. Use HTML tags and CSS classes to define the desired structure and styling.

For example, you can create a header section at the top of the page using the `<header>` tag:

```html
<div class="container">
  <header>
    <h1>Lead Management System</h1>
    <!-- Other header elements go here -->
  </header>
  <!-- More sections and elements go here -->
</div>
```

Similarly, you can create other sections such as a sidebar, content area, and footer. Use appropriate HTML tags and CSS classes to represent these sections:

```html
<div class="container">
  <header>
    <h1>Lead Management System</h1>
    <!-- Other header elements go here -->
  </header>
  <aside class="sidebar">
    <!-- Sidebar content goes here -->
  </aside>
  <main class="content">
    <!-- Main content goes here -->
  </main>
  <footer>
    <!-- Footer content goes here -->
  </footer>
</div>
```

### Step 4: Apply CSS Styles

To style the layout, you will use CSS. Create a separate CSS file and link it to your HTML file using the `<link>` tag within the `<head>` section.

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

In the CSS file, you can define the styles for the different sections and elements of your layout. Use CSS selectors to target the desired elements and apply styling rules.

For example, to style the header section with a background color and center-aligned text:

```css
header {
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Similarly, you can define styles for the sidebar, content area, and footer sections, as well as any other elements within them.

### Step 5: Save and Preview the Page

Save your HTML and CSS files. Ensure that both files are in the same directory and that the CSS file is linked correctly in the HTML file. Then, open the HTML file in a web browser to see the layout you have created.

You should now have a basic layout for your lead management system, with styled sections and elements.

### Step 6: Refine and Customize the Layout

Feel free to further refine and customize the layout according to your requirements. Experiment with different CSS styles, adjust element sizes and positions, and add additional sections or elements as needed.

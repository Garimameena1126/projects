# Step-by-Step Guide: Connecting the Backend to the Frontend to Send/Receive Data

In this task, we will connect the backend server to the frontend to enable sending and receiving data between the two components. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Prerequisites

- Backend server set up using a web framework (e.g., Node.js with Express)
- Frontend application set up (e.g., using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
- API endpoints for retrieving and storing exercise data already implemented in the backend

## Steps

1. **Set Up CORS**

   To allow cross-origin requests from the frontend to the backend, we need to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). This ensures that the browser permits requests from different origins (e.g., `localhost:3000` for frontend and `localhost:5000` for backend).

   In your backend server code (e.g., `server.js`), add the following code before defining your routes:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const cors = require('cors');

   const app = express();

   // Enable CORS
   app.use(cors());
   ```

   This code imports the `cors` middleware and adds it to the Express application using `app.use(cors())`. Now the backend will respond to requests from the frontend.

2. **Define API Routes in the Backend**

   In your backend server code, define the API routes that will be used to send and receive data from the frontend.

   For example, let's assume you have the following API endpoints already defined in your backend:

   - `GET /exercises` - Retrieve all exercises
   - `POST /exercises` - Create a new exercise

   Ensure that these endpoints are already implemented and functional.

3. **Send a GET Request from the Frontend**

   In your frontend code (e.g., `index.html`), add JavaScript code to send a GET request to the backend and retrieve the exercises.

   ```html
   <script>
     // Make a GET request to retrieve exercises
     fetch('http://localhost:5000/exercises')
       .then((response) => response.json())
       .then((data) => {
         console.log(data);
         // Handle the retrieved exercises data
       })
       .catch((error) => {
         console.error('Failed to retrieve exercises:', error);
       });
   </script>
   ```

   In this code, we use the `fetch` API to send a GET request to `http://localhost:5000/exercises`, which is the endpoint in the backend for retrieving exercises. We then handle the response by parsing it as JSON and logging it to the console. You can modify the code inside the `.then` block to handle the retrieved exercises data according to your application's requirements.

4. **Send a POST Request from the Frontend**

   In your frontend code, add JavaScript code to send a POST request to the backend and create a new exercise.

   ```html
   <script>
     // Example exercise data
     const exerciseData = {
       name: 'Push-ups',
       duration: 10,
       calories: 50,
     };

     // Make a POST request to create a new exercise
     fetch('http://localhost:5000/exercises', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       },
       body: JSON.stringify(exerciseData),
     })
       .then((response) => response.json())
       .then((data) => {
         console.log(data);
         // Handle the response data
       })
       .catch((error) => {
         console.error('Failed to create exercise:', error);
       });
   </script>
    ```

   In this code, we define an `exerciseData` object that contains the exercise details (name, duration, and calories). We then use the `fetch` API to send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/exercises` with the exercise data in the request body. The `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`, indicating that we are sending JSON data. Again, you can modify the code inside the `.then` block to handle the response data as per your application's requirements.

5. **Test the Integration**

   Start both the backend and frontend servers, and open your frontend application in a browser. Verify that you can retrieve exercises from the backend by checking the browser console for the logged data. Additionally, test creating a new exercise and verify that it is successfully stored on the backend.

   By following this guide, you have successfully connected the backend to the frontend, allowing you to send and receive data between the two components of your application.

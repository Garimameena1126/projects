##  Calorie Intake Prediction

In this module, we will use the trained model to predict daily calorie intake based on user input of characteristics and dietary information. We will develop a simple command-line application where users can input their details, and the model will predict their calorie intake. 

### Step 1: Set Up the Command-Line Application

First, let's set up the command-line application where users can input their details and get the calorie intake prediction. We will use Python to build this application. Follow the steps below:

1. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice.
2. Create a new Python file and save it as `calorie_intake_prediction.py`.

### Step 2: Import the Necessary Libraries

To create the command-line application and utilize the trained model, we need to import some libraries. Add the following lines of code at the beginning of your `calorie_intake_prediction.py` file:

```python
import joblib
import numpy as np
```

### Step 3: Load the Trained Model

Next, we need to load the trained model that was saved during the model training phase. Make sure you have the trained model file (e.g., `calorie_intake_model.pkl`) available in the same directory as your `calorie_intake_prediction.py` file.

Add the following code to load the trained model:

```python
model = joblib.load('calorie_intake_model.pkl')
```

### Step 4: Gather User Input

Now, let's gather the necessary user input for predicting the calorie intake. In this example, we will ask the user for their age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and dietary information.

Add the following code to gather user input:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
gender = input("Enter your gender (male/female): ")
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in centimeters: "))
activity_level = float(input("Enter your activity level (1.2 for sedentary, 1.375 for light activity, 1.55 for moderate activity, 1.725 for active, 1.9 for very active): "))
dietary_info = float(input("Enter your dietary information: "))
```

### Step 5: Preprocess User Input

Before making the prediction, we need to preprocess the user input to match the format expected by the trained model. This involves encoding categorical variables (gender) and performing feature scaling on numerical variables (age, weight, height, activity level, dietary information).

Add the following code to preprocess the user input:

```python
# Encode gender
if gender.lower() == 'male':
    encoded_gender = 0
else:
    encoded_gender = 1

# Perform feature scaling
user_input = np.array([[age, encoded_gender, weight, height, activity_level, dietary_info]])
# Apply feature scaling based on the preprocessing steps performed during model training

# Replace 'feature_scaling_function' with the appropriate feature scaling function used during model training
scaled_input = feature_scaling_function(user_input)
```

Replace `'feature_scaling_function'` with the specific feature scaling function that was used during the preprocessing and feature engineering phase of the model training. Make sure to use the same function or process to scale the user input as you used for the training data.

### Step 6: Make the Prediction

Now, we can use the preprocessed user input to make the calorie intake prediction using the trained model.

Add the following code to make the prediction:

```python
calorie_intake_prediction = model.predict(scaled_input)
```

### Step 7: Display the Prediction

Finally , let's display the predicted calorie intake to the user.

Add the following code to display the prediction:

```python
print("Your predicted calorie intake is:", calorie_intake_prediction)
```

### Step 8: Complete the Application

To complete the command-line application, we need to wrap the code within a loop so that the user can make multiple predictions if desired.

Add the following code at the end of your `calorie_intake_prediction.py` file:

```python
while True:
    age = int(input("Enter your age (or enter -1 to exit): "))
    if age == -1:
        break

    # Rest of the code for gathering user input, preprocessing, making the prediction, and displaying the result

print("Application exited.")
```

This loop allows the user to keep entering their age for predictions until they enter `-1` to exit the application.

### Step 9: Run the Application

Save the changes to your `calorie_intake_prediction.py` file and run the application using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python calorie_intake_prediction.py
```

Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information when prompted. The application will display the predicted calorie intake based on the user input.

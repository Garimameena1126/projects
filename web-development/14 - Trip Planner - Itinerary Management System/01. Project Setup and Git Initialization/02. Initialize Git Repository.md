## Initializing a Git Repository

In this guide, we will walk through the steps to initialize a Git repository for your web development project. Initializing a Git repository allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and easily revert to previous versions of your code. We will assume that you have already set up your project folder and are ready to initialize the Git repository.

### Step 1: Open Command Line Interface

To initialize a Git repository, you will need to use the command line interface (CLI). Here's how to open the CLI on different operating systems:

- **Windows**: Press the `Win + R` keys to open the Run dialog. Type `cmd` and press Enter.
- **Mac**: Press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight Search. Type `Terminal` and press Enter.
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open the terminal.

### Step 2: Navigate to Project Folder

Using the CLI, navigate to the project folder where you want to initialize the Git repository. Use the `cd` command followed by the path to your project folder. For example:

```bash
cd path/to/project-folder
```

Replace `path/to/project-folder` with the actual path to your project folder on your machine.

### Step 3: Initialize Git Repository

Once you are inside your project folder in the CLI, run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

This command sets up an empty Git repository in your project folder. You should see a message like this:

```bash
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/project-folder/.git/
```

### Step 4: Add Files to the Repository

After initializing the Git repository, you can start adding files to be tracked. Use the following command to add all the files in your project folder to the repository:

```bash
git add .
```

The `.` refers to all files in the current directory.

### Step 5: Commit Changes

Once you have added the files to the repository, you need to commit your changes. A commit is a record of the changes you have made to your code. Use the following command to commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

The `-m` flag allows you to add a commit message. In this case, we use `"Initial commit"` as the message, but you can customize it to describe the changes you made.

### Step 6: Verify Repository Initialization

To verify that your Git repository has been initialized successfully, you can use the following command:

```bash
git status
```

This command will display the current status of your repository. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message like this:

```bash
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

# Module 3: Collaborative Filtering

In this module, we will implement a collaborative filtering approach to generate recommendations based on user preferences and similarities to other users. Collaborative filtering is a widely used technique in recommendation systems that leverages the behavior and preferences of multiple users to make personalized recommendations. There are two main types of collaborative filtering: user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering. In this guide, we will explore both approaches and provide detailed step-by-step instructions on how to calculate recommendations using each technique.

## User-Based Collaborative Filtering

User-based collaborative filtering recommends items to a user based on the similarities between that user and other users. The idea behind this approach is that if two users have similar preferences or behaviors, they are likely to have similar tastes in items and can be used to make recommendations. The following steps outline the process of implementing user-based collaborative filtering:

### Step 1: Load and Prepare the Data

1. Start by loading the dataset that contains user preferences and item ratings. The dataset should have a structure where each row represents a user, and each column represents an item or a rating.

2. Preprocess the dataset to handle any missing values or inconsistencies. Depending on the dataset, you may need to perform tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, or normalizing the ratings.

### Step 2: Calculate Similarity Scores

1. For user-based collaborative filtering, we need to calculate the similarity between users. One common similarity measure is the cosine similarity. To calculate the cosine similarity between two users, follow these steps:

   - Select two users, let's call them User A and User B.
   - Retrieve the ratings of both users for the items they have in common.
   - Calculate the dot product of the ratings vectors of User A and User B.
   - Calculate the magnitude (Euclidean norm) of the ratings vectors of User A and User B.
   - Divide the dot product by the product of the magnitudes to obtain the cosine similarity score.

2. Repeat the above steps for each pair of users in the dataset to create a similarity matrix. The similarity matrix will capture the similarities between each user and all other users.

### Step 3: Find Similar Users

1. Once you have the similarity matrix, you can identify the most similar users to a target user based on their similarity scores. Choose a threshold similarity score above which users will be considered similar.

2. Sort the users based on their similarity scores in descending order and select the top N similar users.

### Step 4: Generate Recommendations

1. To generate recommendations for a target user, consider the items that the similar users have rated highly but the target user has not yet rated.

2. Calculate a weighted average of the ratings given by the similar users for each item, where the weights are the similarity scores between the target user and the similar users.

3. Sort the items based on their weighted average ratings and recommend the top K items to the target user.

### Example

Let's illustrate the process of user-based collaborative filtering with a simplified example. Assume we have the following ratings matrix:

|         | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| User A  | 5      | 3      | 4      | -      |
| User B  | 4      | -      | 2      | 1      |
| User C  | -      | 1      | -      | 4      |
| User D  | 2      | 4      | -      | 5      |

1. Calculate the cosine similarity between User A and User B:
   - Ratings in common: Item 1 (5), Item 3 (4)


   - Dot product: (5 * 4) + (4 * 2) = 26
   - Magnitude of User A: sqrt(5^2 + 3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(50)
   - Magnitude of User B: sqrt(4^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(21)
   - Cosine similarity: 26 / (sqrt(50) * sqrt(21))

2. Repeat the above step for other user pairs to obtain a similarity matrix.

3. Suppose we want to generate recommendations for User A. Find the most similar users based on the similarity matrix, let's say User C and User D.

4. User C rated Item 2 highly (rating of 1), and User D rated Item 4 highly (rating of 5). Calculate the weighted average ratings for the items that User A has not rated:
   - Weighted average for Item 2: (similarity(User C, User A) * rating(User C, Item 2)) = (similarity(User C, User A) * 1)
   - Weighted average for Item 4: (similarity(User D, User A) * rating(User D, Item 4)) = (similarity(User D, User A) * 5)

5. Sort the items based on their weighted average ratings and recommend the top items to User A.

## Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Item-based collaborative filtering recommends items to a user based on the similarities between the items themselves. The idea is that if two items have been rated similarly by many users, they are likely to be related and can be used to make recommendations. Follow these steps to implement item-based collaborative filtering:

### Step 1: Load and Prepare the Data

1. Start by loading the dataset that contains user preferences and item ratings. The dataset should have a structure where each row represents a user, and each column represents an item or a rating.

2. Preprocess the dataset to handle any missing values or inconsistencies. Depending on the dataset, you may need to perform tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, or normalizing the ratings.

### Step 2: Calculate Item Similarity

1. For item-based collaborative filtering, we need to calculate the similarity between items. Similarity measures such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation coefficient can be used. To calculate the similarity between two items, follow these steps:

   - Select two items, let's call them Item X and Item Y.
   - Retrieve the ratings of both items from all users who have rated both items.
   - Calculate the similarity between the ratings vectors of Item X and Item Y using a similarity measure.

2. Repeat the above steps for each pair of items in the dataset to create an item similarity matrix. The item similarity matrix will capture the similarities between each item and all other items.

### Step 3: Find Similar Items

1. Once you have the item similarity matrix, you can identify the most similar items to a target item based on their similarity scores. Choose a threshold similarity score above which items will be considered similar.

2. Sort the items based on their similarity scores in descending order and select the top N similar items.

### Step 4: Generate Recommendations

1. To generate recommendations for a target user, consider the items that the user has rated highly, and find the most similar items to those highly rated items.

2. Calculate a weighted average of the ratings given to the similar items by the target user, where the weights are the similarity scores between the highly rated items and the similar items.

3. Sort the items based on their weighted average ratings and recommend the top K items to the target user.

### Example

Let's illustrate the process

 of item-based collaborative filtering with a simplified example. Assume we have the following ratings matrix:

|         | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| User A  | 5      | 3      | 4      | -      |
| User B  | 4      | -      | 2      | 1      |
| User C  | -      | 1      | -      | 4      |
| User D  | 2      | 4      | -      | 5      |

1. Calculate the cosine similarity between Item 1 and Item 2:
   - Ratings in common: User A (5), User B (4)
   - Dot product: (5 * 4) + (4 * 3) = 32
   - Magnitude of Item 1: sqrt(5^2 + 4^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(45)
   - Magnitude of Item 2: sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(25)
   - Cosine similarity: 32 / (sqrt(45) * sqrt(25))

2. Repeat the above step for other item pairs to obtain an item similarity matrix.

3. Suppose we want to generate recommendations for User A. Find the items that User A has rated highly, let's say Item 1 and Item 3.

4. Item 1 is similar to Item 2, and Item 3 is similar to Item 4. Calculate the weighted average ratings for the similar items:
   - Weighted average for Item 2: (similarity(Item 1, Item 2) * rating(User A, Item 2)) = (similarity(Item 1, Item 2) * 3)
   - Weighted average for Item 4: (similarity(Item 3, Item 4) * rating(User A, Item 4)) = (similarity(Item 3, Item 4) * 4)

5. Sort the items based on their weighted average ratings and recommend the top items to User A.

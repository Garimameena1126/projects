# Task: Display Suggested Exercises in the UI for the User to Choose From

In this task, we will focus on displaying suggested exercises in the user interface (UI) for the user to choose from. This will allow users to see a list of exercise options retrieved from the chosen fitness API and select the ones they prefer. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Create the Exercise Suggestions Container

First, create a container element in your HTML where the exercise suggestions will be displayed. This container will be manipulated dynamically to show the suggestions.

```html
<!-- HTML exercise suggestions container -->
<div id="exercise-suggestions"></div>
```

## Step 2: Retrieve Exercise Suggestions from API

Assuming you have already implemented the API calls to retrieve exercise suggestions based on user input (as covered in a previous task), ensure that you have the exercise data available in your JavaScript code. This could be an array of exercise objects.

```javascript
// Sample exercise data
const exerciseSuggestions = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Push-ups' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Sit-ups' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Squats' },
  // Add more exercise objects as needed
];
```

In this example, `exerciseSuggestions` is an array containing exercise objects. Each exercise object should have a unique identifier (`id`) and a name (`name`) that represents the exercise.

## Step 3: Display Exercise Suggestions in the UI

Using JavaScript, write a function to populate the exercise suggestions container with the retrieved exercise data.

```javascript
function displayExerciseSuggestions() {
  const suggestionsContainer = document.getElementById('exercise-suggestions');

  // Clear any existing suggestions
  suggestionsContainer.innerHTML = '';

  // Iterate over the exercise suggestions and create a list
  const exerciseList = document.createElement('ul');
  exerciseSuggestions.forEach(exercise => {
    const exerciseItem = document.createElement('li');
    exerciseItem.textContent = exercise.name;
    exerciseList.appendChild(exerciseItem);
  });

  // Append the list to the suggestions container
  suggestionsContainer.appendChild(exerciseList);
}

// Call the function to display the exercise suggestions
displayExerciseSuggestions();
```

The `displayExerciseSuggestions` function creates an unordered list (`<ul>`) and appends list items (`<li>`) for each exercise in the `exerciseSuggestions` array. Adjust the code inside the `forEach` loop to match the structure of your exercise data.

## Step 4: Style the Exercise Suggestions

To enhance the visual appearance of the exercise suggestions, you can apply CSS styles to the container and its child elements. Here's an example CSS snippet to get you started:

```css
/* CSS styling for exercise suggestions */
#exercise-suggestions {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
}

#exercise-suggestions ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

#exercise-suggestions li {
  margin-bottom: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

#exercise-suggestions li:hover {
  background-color: #f4f4f4;
}
```

Adjust the CSS styles according to your project's design requirements.

## Step 5: Handling Exercise Selection

To capture the user's selection of exercises from the UI, you can add an event listener to the exercise suggestions container. In this example, we'll assume that selecting an exercise triggers a function called `handleExerciseSelection`.

```javascript
// JavaScript event handling for exercise selection
const suggestionsContainer = document.getElementById('exercise-suggestions');

suggestionsContainer.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  const selectedExercise = event.target.textContent;
  handleExercise

Selection(selectedExercise);
});

function handleExerciseSelection(exerciseName) {
  // Do something with the selected exercise
  console.log('Selected exercise:', exerciseName);
}
```

When a user clicks on an exercise in the UI, the `click` event listener will trigger the `handleExerciseSelection` function, passing the selected exercise name as a parameter. Customize the `handleExerciseSelection` function to perform the desired action based on the selected exercise.

1. Open your text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Open the `index.html` file that contains the form structure.

3. Locate the `<form>` element within the `<body>` section.

4. Inside the `<form>` element, add the necessary form fields if you haven't already done so. For example, you can have fields like name, email, phone, and destination.

   ```html
   <form>
     <label for="name">Name:</label>
     <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

     <label for="email">Email:</label>
     <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

     <label for="phone">Phone:</label>
     <input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" required>

     <label for="destination">Destination:</label>
     <input type="text" id="destination" name="destination" required>
   </form>
   ```

5. To ensure that the required fields are not left empty, we have added the `required` attribute to each input field. This attribute enforces the user to provide values for these fields before submitting the form.

6. To validate the email format, we can use the `pattern` attribute with a regular expression. Modify the email input field as follows:

   ```html
   <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}">
   ```

   In the example, the regular expression pattern `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}` validates that the email address entered matches the standard email format. You can customize the pattern as per your specific requirements.

7. Save the `index.html` file.

8. Congratulations! You have successfully added validation to the form inputs.

   When a user tries to submit the form without providing values for the required fields or enters an invalid email format, the browser will display a validation message indicating the error. You can further customize the styling of the validation messages using CSS.

   Remember to save your changes regularly and test the form in the browser to ensure the validation works as expected.

That's it! You have completed the task of validating the form inputs in the booking form using HTML.

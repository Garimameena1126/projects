# Module 3: Model Selection and Training

In this module, we will focus on selecting an appropriate regression model for flight price prediction. We will explore different options such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Once we choose a model, we will split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets, and finally train the selected model using the training data.

## Step 1: Import Required Libraries

Before we begin, let's import the necessary libraries for our project. We will be using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python, for model selection and training. Additionally, we'll import other libraries for data handling and evaluation.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
```

## Step 2: Load Preprocessed Data

Assuming you have already preprocessed the flight data and saved it in a file (e.g., `preprocessed_data.csv`), we will load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
# Load the preprocessed data
data = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_data.csv')
```

## Step 3: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

To evaluate the performance of our regression models, we need to split the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the models, while the testing set will be used to assess their predictive performance.

```python
# Separate features (X) and target variable (y)
X = data.drop('flight_price', axis=1)
y = data['flight_price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

In the code above, we split the data into 80% training set and 20% testing set. Adjust the `test_size` parameter as per your preference.

## Step 4: Select and Train the Regression Model

Now, let's select an appropriate regression model for flight price prediction and train it using the training data. We will consider three popular regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

### 4.1 Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful linear model for regression tasks. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).

```python
# Create a Linear Regression model
linear_reg = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
linear_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 4.2 Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It can handle complex relationships between features and the target variable.

```python
# Create a Random Forest Regressor model
random_forest = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)

# Train the model
random_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 4.3 Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting is another ensemble learning technique that builds an ensemble of weak prediction models (typically decision trees) in a stage-wise manner. It iteratively improves the model's performance by minimizing a loss function.

```python
# Create a Gradient Boosting Regressor model
gradient_boosting = GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=42)

# Train the model
gradient_boosting.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 5: Evaluate the Trained Model

After training the regression models, we need to evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics. In our case, we will use Mean Absolute Error (MA

E) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the prediction accuracy.

```python
# Make predictions on the testing set
linear_reg_preds = linear_reg.predict(X_test)
random_forest_preds = random_forest.predict(X_test)
gradient_boosting_preds = gradient_boosting.predict(X_test)

# Calculate MAE and RMSE for each model
linear_reg_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, linear_reg_preds)
linear_reg_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, linear_reg_preds, squared=False)

random_forest_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, random_forest_preds)
random_forest_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, random_forest_preds, squared=False)

gradient_boosting_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, gradient_boosting_preds)
gradient_boosting_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, gradient_boosting_preds, squared=False)
```

## Step 6: Model Comparison (Optional)

If you want to compare the performance of different regression models, you can calculate the metrics and compare them. This step is optional but can provide insights into which model performs better for flight price prediction.

```python
# Create a DataFrame to compare model performance
model_comparison = pd.DataFrame({
    'Model': ['Linear Regression', 'Random Forest', 'Gradient Boosting'],
    'MAE': [linear_reg_mae, random_forest_mae, gradient_boosting_mae],
    'RMSE': [linear_reg_rmse, random_forest_rmse, gradient_boosting_rmse]
})

# Display the model comparison
model_comparison
```

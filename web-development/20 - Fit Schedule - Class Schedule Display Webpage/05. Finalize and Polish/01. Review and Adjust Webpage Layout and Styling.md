#### Task: Review the webpage layout and styling for any necessary adjustments.

1. Open the "index.html" file in a web browser to view the webpage you have created so far.
2. Take a careful look at the webpage and assess its layout and styling. Pay attention to the following aspects:

   a. Overall layout: Examine the placement and alignment of different elements on the page, such as the header, navigation bar, and class schedule display section. Ensure that the layout looks visually appealing and organized.

   b. Typography: Consider the choice of fonts, font sizes, and line spacing used throughout the webpage. Ensure that the text is readable and visually pleasing.

   c. Colors: Evaluate the color scheme used in your webpage, including the background color, text color, and any other elements with color. Ensure that the colors are harmonious and convey the desired aesthetic.

   d. Responsive design: Resize the browser window or use developer tools to test how the webpage responds to different screen sizes. Verify that the layout adjusts gracefully and remains usable on various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

3. If you identify any areas that require adjustments, proceed with the following steps to refine the layout and styling:

   a. CSS adjustments: Open the CSS file associated with your project (e.g., "styles.css" or any other file where your CSS rules are defined).

   b. Locate the appropriate CSS selectors that control the styling of the elements you wish to modify. For example, you might have selectors for the header, navigation bar, or class schedule display section.

   c. Adjust the CSS properties of the selected elements to refine the layout and styling. Here are a few common properties you may need to modify:

      - `margin` and `padding`: Use these properties to control spacing around elements and adjust the overall layout.

      - `font-family` and `font-size`: Specify the desired font family and size to enhance readability.

      - `color` and `background-color`: Set the text color and background color to achieve the desired visual effect.

      - `width` and `height`: Adjust these properties to control the dimensions of elements, ensuring they fit well within the layout.

   d. Save the changes made to the CSS file.

4. Refresh the webpage in the browser to observe the impact of your modifications.

5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 as needed until you are satisfied with the layout and styling of your webpage.

6. Validate the HTML and CSS code to ensure adherence to best practices and standards:

   a. For HTML validation, you can use the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) by copying and pasting your HTML code into the provided input field. Address any reported errors or warnings by modifying the HTML code accordingly.

   b. For CSS validation, you can use the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) by uploading your CSS file or pasting the CSS code. Resolve any reported errors or warnings by adjusting your CSS code appropriately.

7. Test the webpage's responsiveness by viewing it on different devices or using browser developer tools:

   a. Open the webpage on a desktop computer and resize the browser window to simulate different screen sizes. Ensure that the webpage remains visually pleasing and functional at various widths.

   b. Use the developer tools in your web browser (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to simulate different devices and screen resolutions. Test the responsiveness of your webpage on devices like tablets and mobile phones. Verify that the layout adapts correctly and maintains usability.

8. Make any required refinements or bug fixes based on your testing and validation results. Repeat the review process until you are satisfied with the final appearance and functionality of your webpage.

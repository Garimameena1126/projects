# Training the Selected Model using the Training Data

In this task, we will train the selected regression model using the preprocessed training data. The training process involves fitting the model to the data, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns and relationships. By the end of this task, you will have a trained model ready for evaluation and prediction.

## Step 1: Import the Required Libraries

Before we start training the model, we need to import the necessary libraries that provide the regression model implementation and other utilities for data manipulation.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
```

Here, we are importing `pandas` for data handling and manipulation, as well as the regression models from `sklearn` (Scikit-learn) library.

## Step 2: Load the Preprocessed Training Data

To train the model, we need to load the preprocessed training data that was prepared in the previous steps. Ensure that you have the preprocessed data stored in a CSV file or any other suitable format.

```python
# Assuming the preprocessed data is stored in a CSV file named 'train_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv('train_data.csv')
```

Replace `'train_data.csv'` with the actual path or filename of your preprocessed training data.

## Step 3: Split the Data into Training and Validation Sets

It is essential to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen data to estimate how well it will generalize to new instances. Therefore, we split the preprocessed data into training and validation sets.

```python
# Separate the input features (X) and the target variable (y)
X = data.drop('price', axis=1)  # assuming 'price' is the column name for the target variable
y = data['price']

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

Here, we are using the `train_test_split` function from Scikit-learn to split the data into a 80% training set (`X_train`, `y_train`) and a 20% validation set (`X_val`, `y_val`). Adjust the `test_size` parameter if you want to modify the proportion of the validation set.

## Step 4: Choose and Train the Regression Model

Now that we have our training and validation sets ready, we can select the appropriate regression model and train it using the training data.

### Option 1: Linear Regression

Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. It fits a straight line to the data that minimizes the sum of squared residuals.

```python
# Create an instance of the Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model using the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Option 2: Random Forest Regression

Random Forest regression is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It can capture non-linear relationships and handle complex interactions between features.

```python
# Create an instance of the Random Forest Regression model
model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)

# Train the model using the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Option 3: Gradient Boosting Regression

Gradient Boosting regression is another ensemble method that builds an ensemble of weak prediction models in a stage-wise manner. It combines the predictions of multiple weak models to create a strong overall prediction.

```python
# Create an instance of the Gradient Boosting Regression model
model = Gradient

BoostingRegressor(random_state=42)

# Train the model using the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Choose the regression model that suits your specific requirements and uncomment the corresponding code block. Comment out the other options that are not being used.

## Step 5: Model Training Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully trained the regression model using the training data. Now, you can proceed to the next module to evaluate the model's performance using the validation set.

#### Task: Include a title for the webpage inside the `<head>` section.

1. Open the "index.html" file that you created in the previous task.
2. Locate the `<head>` opening and closing tags within the HTML structure.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- Title should be added here -->
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

3. Between the `<head>` opening and closing tags, add the `<title>` element to specify the title of the webpage. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Health and Fitness Class Schedule</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

Explanation:
- The `<title>` element is used to define the title of the HTML document.
- Whatever you specify within the `<title>` tags will be displayed as the title of the webpage in the browser's title bar or tab.

4. Save the file.

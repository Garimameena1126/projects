To store new leads in the database, we need to implement the necessary functionality in our application. Follow these steps to accomplish this task:

## Step 1: Retrieve Lead Information

Before inserting a new lead into the database, we need to retrieve the lead information from the user or from any other source within your application. Ensure that you have a mechanism in place to collect the required lead details, such as name, email, phone number, etc.

## Step 2: Establish a Database Connection

To interact with the database, establish a connection between your application and the database. Refer to the previous guide on how to establish a connection and make sure to follow the steps mentioned there.

## Step 3: Prepare the Insert Query

Create a query to insert the lead information into the database. The query should include the appropriate table name and the column names corresponding to the lead information you collected.

For example, using SQL syntax, a sample insert query might look like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO leads (name, email, phone) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com', '1234567890');
```

Make sure to replace `'John Doe'`, `'johndoe@example.com'`, and `'1234567890'` with the actual lead information you retrieved from Step 1.

## Step 4: Execute the Insert Query

Using the database connection established in Step 2, execute the insert query to insert the new lead into the database.

Refer to the documentation or appropriate guides for your chosen database driver or library to learn how to execute queries.

For example, using Python with the `mysql` driver, you would execute the insert query as follows:

```python
cursor = connection.cursor()
insert_query = "INSERT INTO leads (name, email, phone) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)"
lead_data = ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com', '1234567890')
cursor.execute(insert_query, lead_data)
connection.commit()
```

Make sure to replace `'John Doe'`, `'johndoe@example.com'`, and `'1234567890'` with the actual lead information you retrieved from Step 1.

## Step 5: Handle Errors and Exceptions

When executing the insert query, it's important to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur. This ensures that your application gracefully handles any issues during the insertion process.

Use appropriate error handling techniques in your programming language to catch and handle any database-related errors or exceptions.

For example, in Python, you can use a try-except block to catch and handle exceptions related to the database:

```python
try:
  cursor = connection.cursor()
  insert_query = "INSERT INTO leads (name, email, phone) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)"
  lead_data = ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com', '1234567890')
  cursor.execute(insert_query, lead_data)
  connection.commit()
  print("Lead inserted successfully!")
except mysql.connector.Error as error:
  print("Error inserting lead:", error)
```

## Step 6: Close the Database Connection

After you have completed the insertion process, close the database connection to free up resources.

Use the provided function or method in your chosen database driver or library to close the connection.

For example, in Python with the `mysql` driver, you would close the connection as follows:

```python
connection.close()
```

Closing the connection ensures that your application releases any acquired database resources and terminates the connection gracefully.

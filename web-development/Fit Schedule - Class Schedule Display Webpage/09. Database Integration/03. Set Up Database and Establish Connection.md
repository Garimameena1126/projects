1. Choose a Suitable Database System:
   - Before setting up the database, decide on a suitable database system that can store and manage the class schedule data. In this example, we will use MongoDB as the database system.
   - Install MongoDB on your machine if you haven't already. You can follow the official MongoDB documentation for installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2. Design the Database Schema:
   - The next step is to design the database schema that will accommodate the class names, timings, instructors, and additional details.
   - Identify the entities and their relationships. Based on the requirements, you can have collections/tables for classes, instructors, and any additional information.
   - Determine the fields/attributes for each collection/table, such as class name, timing, instructor name, etc.
   - Define the relationships between the collections/tables, if any. For example, you may have a reference from the class collection/table to the instructor collection/table.

3. Set up the Necessary Database Tables/Collections:
   - Open the MongoDB shell or use a graphical user interface (GUI) like MongoDB Compass to interact with the database.
   - Create a new database specifically for your project. In the MongoDB shell, you can use the following command:
     ```shell
     use class_schedule_db
     ```
     Replace "class_schedule_db" with your desired database name.
   - Create the necessary collections/tables. In MongoDB, collections are created automatically when data is inserted. Therefore, you can proceed with the next step to establish the connection, and the collections will be created as data is inserted.

4. Establish a Connection between the Backend and the Database:
   - In your backend code, you need to establish a connection to the MongoDB database.
   - Install the necessary MongoDB driver or library for your programming language. For Node.js, you can use the "mongodb" package.
   - Require/import the MongoDB library in your backend code. In Node.js, you can use the following code:
     ```javascript
     const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
     ```
   - Set up the connection parameters, such as the database URL and any authentication details. For example:
     ```javascript
     const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/class_schedule_db';
     const options = { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true };
     ```
     Replace the URL with the appropriate connection string for your MongoDB instance and the database name you chose earlier.
   - Connect to the database using the established connection parameters. Here's an example:
     ```javascript
     MongoClient.connect(url, options, (err, client) => {
       if (err) {
         console.error('Error connecting to the database:', err);
         // Handle the error appropriately
       } else {
         const db = client.db(); // Get a reference to the database
         // Proceed with further operations or start the server
       }
     });
     ```

5. Modify the Backend Code for CRUD Operations:
   - Update your backend code to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the class schedule data.
   - Use the MongoDB driver/library to perform database operations such as inserting new classes, retrieving class data, updating class information, or deleting classes.
   - For example, to insert a new class into the "classes" collection, you can use the following code:
     ```javascript
     const class = { name: 'Yoga', timing: '10:00 AM- 11:00 AM', instructor: 'John Doe' }; db.collection('classes').insertOne(class, (err, result) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error inserting class:', err);
        // Handle the error appropriately
      } else {
        console.log('Class inserted successfully');
        // Handle the successful insertion
      }});

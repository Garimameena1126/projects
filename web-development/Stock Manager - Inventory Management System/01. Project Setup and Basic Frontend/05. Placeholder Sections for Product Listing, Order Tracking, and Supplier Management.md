# Adding Placeholder Sections for Product Listing, Order Tracking, and Supplier Management

In this guide, we will add placeholder sections to the inventory management system's homepage for product listing, order tracking, and supplier management. These sections will provide an outline for the functionality to be implemented in future steps.

## Step 1: Update HTML Structure

1. Open the `index.html` file in your text editor.
2. Locate the `<section id="homepage">` element.
3. Inside the `<section id="homepage">` element, add three `<div>` elements to represent the placeholder sections for product listing, order tracking, and supplier management:
```html
<section id="homepage">
    <img src="path/to/logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
    <p>Welcome to our inventory management system. We provide a comprehensive solution for tracking and managing your products, orders, and suppliers.</p>
    
    <div id="product-listing">
        <!-- Placeholder content for product listing section -->
    </div>
    
    <div id="order-tracking">
        <!-- Placeholder content for order tracking section -->
    </div>
    
    <div id="supplier-management">
        <!-- Placeholder content for supplier management section -->
    </div>
</section>
```

## Step 2: Style Placeholder Sections with CSS

1. Open the `styles.css` file in your text editor.
2. Add CSS rules to style the placeholder sections. You can customize the styles according to your project's design:
```css
#product-listing, #order-tracking, #supplier-management {
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
    padding: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

## Step 3: Save and Preview

1. Save the changes made to the `index.html` and `styles.css` files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Verify that the homepage is displayed with the company logo, description, and placeholder sections for product listing, order tracking, and supplier management.

# Module 5: Implement Fitness Goals and Progress Tracking

## Task: Implement Basic Analytics and Visualizations for the User's Fitness Progress

In this task, we will implement basic analytics and visualizations to help users track their fitness progress. We will display statistics related to workout data, such as calories burned, and create visualizations to present the data in a user-friendly manner. Follow the steps below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Retrieve User's Workout Data

To perform analytics and visualizations on the user's fitness progress, we need to retrieve their workout data from the database. This data may include information such as exercise duration, calories burned, distance covered, and so on. Follow these steps to retrieve the workout data:

1. Ensure that you have a database set up to store user data. This can be a SQL database, a NoSQL database, or any other database of your choice.

2. Establish a connection to the database using appropriate credentials and configuration settings. Refer to the documentation of your chosen database for specific instructions.

3. Write a query to retrieve the user's workout data from the database. This query should fetch relevant fields such as exercise duration, calories burned, and date/time of the workout. Here's an example query using SQL:

   ```sql
   SELECT duration, calories_burned, workout_date FROM workouts WHERE user_id = 'user123';
   ```

   Customize the query based on your database schema and structure. Replace `'user123'` with the actual user ID or identifier.

4. Execute the query and retrieve the result set containing the workout data.

## Step 2: Calculate Fitness Statistics

Once we have the user's workout data, we can calculate fitness statistics to provide insights into their progress. Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you can calculate various statistics such as total calories burned, average exercise duration, maximum distance covered, and more. Follow these steps to calculate fitness statistics:

1. Iterate through the retrieved workout data and perform the necessary calculations. Here's an example code snippet in JavaScript:

   ```javascript
   // Assuming `workouts` is the result set containing workout data

   let totalCaloriesBurned = 0;
   let totalDuration = 0;
   let maxDistance = 0;

   for (const workout of workouts) {
       totalCaloriesBurned += workout.calories_burned;
       totalDuration += workout.duration;
       maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, workout.distance);
   }
   ```

   Customize the calculations based on the specific fields and requirements of your application.

2. Store the calculated statistics in variables or data structures for later use in visualizations.

## Step 3: Implement Basic Visualizations

Now that we have the necessary workout data and calculated fitness statistics, we can create basic visualizations to help users track their progress. There are various visualization libraries and tools available, such as Chart.js, D3.js, or even simple HTML and CSS techniques. For simplicity, we will demonstrate a basic visualization using HTML and CSS. Follow these steps to implement the visualization:

1. Create a new HTML file or modify an existing file where you want to display the fitness progress visualization.

2. Add a container element in the HTML file where the visualization will be displayed. This can be a `<div>` element with an appropriate ID or class attribute.

   ```html
   <div id="fitness-progress-chart"></div>
   ```

3. Use CSS to style the container element and provide dimensions for the visualization.

   ```html
   <style>
   #fitness-progress-chart {
       width: 400px;
       height: 300px;
   }
   </style>
   ```

   Customize the dimensions and styling as desired.

4. Write JavaScript code

 to create a basic chart using the workout data and fitness statistics. Here's an example using Chart.js:

   ```javascript
   // Assuming `workouts` and fitness statistics variables are available

   const ctx = document.getElementById('fitness-progress-chart').getContext('2d');

   const chart = new Chart(ctx, {
       type: 'bar',
       data: {
           labels: workouts.map(workout => workout.workout_date),
           datasets: [{
               label: 'Calories Burned',
               data: workouts.map(workout => workout.calories_burned),
               backgroundColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
               borderColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
               borderWidth: 1
           }]
       },
       options: {
           scales: {
               y: {
                   beginAtZero: true
               }
           }
       }
   });
   ```

   Customize the chart type, labels, datasets, and options based on your specific requirements. Refer to the documentation of your chosen visualization library for more details.

5. Save the HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the basic fitness progress visualization.

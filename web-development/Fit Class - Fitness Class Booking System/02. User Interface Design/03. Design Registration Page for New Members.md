# Designing a Registration Page for New Members

In this guide, we will go through the process of designing a registration page for new members to create an account in your fitness class booking system web application. The registration page will allow users to provide their information and create a new account. Let's get started with the step-by-step instructions.

## Step 1: Create the HTML Structure
1. Open your preferred code editor.
2. In your project folder, locate the `public` directory (assuming you have set up the project structure as mentioned in the previous guide).
3. Inside the `public` directory, create a new file called `registration.html`.
4. Open the `registration.html` file in your code editor.
5. Add the following code to create the basic HTML structure of the registration page:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Registration</title>
        <!-- Add any necessary CSS or Bootstrap CDN links here -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Registration</h1>
        <!-- Add your registration form and fields here -->
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

## Step 2: Add Registration Form Fields
1. Inside the `<body>` tag of the `registration.html` file, add the following code to create a registration form:

    ```html
    <form action="/register" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Full Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
    
        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
    
        <label for="confirm-password">Confirm Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="confirm-password" name="confirm-password" required>
    
        <button type="submit">Register</button>
    </form>
    ```

2. In the code snippet above, we have added form fields for the user to enter their full name, email address, password, and confirm password. The form also includes a submit button.

## Step 3: Style the Registration Page
1. To style the registration page, you can make use of CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap. If you're using Bootstrap, you can include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in the `<head>` section of the `registration.html` file.
2. Modify the HTML code of the registration form to include Bootstrap classes and styling. For example, you can add the `form-control` class to the input fields to style them as Bootstrap form controls.
3. Customize the styling as per your project requirements and design preferences.

    ```html
    <form action="/register" method="POST" class="form">
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="name">Full Name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="name" name="name" class="form-control" required>
        </div>
    
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="email">Email:</label>
            <input type="email" id="email" name="email" class="form-control" required>
        </div>
    
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="password" name="password" class="form-control" required>
        </div>
    
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="confirm-password">Confirm Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="confirm-password" name="confirm-password" class="form-control" required>
        </div
    
    >
    
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Register</button>
    </form>
    ```

4. Customize the Bootstrap classes and styles as needed to match your project's design.

## Step 4: Save and Test
1. Save the changes made to the `registration.html` file.
2. Open your web browser.
3. Navigate to the registration page by entering the URL corresponding to the `registration.html` file in the browser's address bar (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/registration.html` if you are running the application locally).
4. Verify that the registration page is displayed with the registration form and fields.
5. Fill in the required information in the form fields and click the "Register" button.
6. Verify that the form submission is being sent to the specified action URL (e.g., `/register`).

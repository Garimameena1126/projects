
## Create a New Folder for the Project

1. Open your preferred file explorer or terminal, depending on your operating system.

2. Navigate to the desired location where you want to create the project folder. This could be your desktop, documents folder, or any other location of your choice.

3. Right-click in the desired location and select "New Folder" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the command line to create a new folder. For example, on a Mac or Linux system, you can use the following command:

   ```
   mkdir project-folder
   ```

   Replace `project-folder` with the desired name for your project folder.

4. Give the folder a meaningful and descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your project. For example, you can name it "travel-booking-form" to align with the project's context.

5. Press Enter or click outside the folder to save the new folder with the specified name.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new folder for your project. Now, let's proceed to the next step.

## Initialize a New Git Repository

To initialize a new Git repository, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project folder you created in the previous step. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

   ```
   cd path/to/project-folder
   ```

   Replace `path/to/project-folder` with the actual path to your project folder.

3. Once you are inside the project folder, run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:

   ```
   git init
   ```

   This command creates a hidden `.git` folder that contains all the necessary files for Git version control.

4. Verify that the repository has been successfully initialized by running the following command:

   ```
   git status
   ```

   You should see a message indicating that you are on the main branch and there are no commits yet.

Great job! You have now initialized a new Git repository for your project. Let's move on to setting up the basic file structure.

## Set Up a Basic File Structure

To set up a basic file structure for your project, follow these steps:

1. Inside the project folder, create the necessary files using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). In this case, we need to create `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.

2. Open your text editor or IDE and create a new file named `index.html`. This file will serve as the main HTML file for your web application.

3. In the `index.html` file, add the basic structure of an HTML document by typing the following code:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>Travel Booking Form</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     </head>
     <body>
       <!-- Content goes here -->
       <script src="script.js"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   This code sets up the basic HTML structure with a `<title>` element for the webpage's title and `<link>` element to link the CSS file.

4. Create a new file named `styles.css` in the project folder. This file will contain the CSS styles for your web application.

5. Open the `styles.css` file and add some sample CSS code. For instance, you can use the following code to give the body a background color:

   ```css
   body {
     background-color: #f0f0f0;
   }
   ```

6. Create another file named `script.js` in the

 project folder. This file will include the JavaScript code for your web application.

7. Open the `script.js` file and add some sample JavaScript code. For example, you can use the following code to log a message to the console:

   ```javascript
   console.log('Hello, world!');
   ```

Congratulations! You have set up the basic file structure for your project, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Next, let's link these files to the HTML file.

## Link the CSS and JavaScript Files to the HTML File

To link the CSS and JavaScript files to the HTML file, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your text editor or IDE.

2. Locate the `<link>` element within the `<head>` section of the HTML file. It should currently be linking to the non-existent `styles.css` file.

3. Update the `href` attribute of the `<link>` element to point to the actual location of your `styles.css` file. For example:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```

   Make sure the `styles.css` file is in the same directory as the `index.html` file.

4. Locate the `<script>` element at the bottom of the HTML file, just before the closing `</body>` tag. It should currently be referencing the non-existent `script.js` file.

5. Update the `src` attribute of the `<script>` element to point to the actual location of your `script.js` file. For example:

   ```html
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```

   Ensure that the `script.js` file is also in the same directory as the `index.html` file.

## Designing the Main Section with a Form

In this guide, we will design the main section of your travel itinerary application. The main section will contain a form that allows users to create a new itinerary. We will use HTML and CSS to create the desired layout and styles.

### Step 1: Set up the HTML Structure

1. Open your HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in a text editor or IDE.
2. Locate the `<main>` element within the `<body>` tags.
3. Inside the `<main>` element, add the following HTML code to create the form for creating a new itinerary:

```html
<main>
  <h1>Create a New Itinerary</h1>
  <form>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
    
    <label for="destination">Destination:</label>
    <input type="text" id="destination" name="destination" required>

    <!-- Add more form fields as needed -->
    
    <button type="submit">Create</button>
  </form>
</main>
```

4. Customize the form fields as per your requirements. Add additional form fields like "Destination", "Date", or "Activities" based on the information you want to collect from the user.

### Step 2: Apply CSS Styling

1. Open your CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
2. Add the following CSS code to style the main section and form:

```css
main {
  padding: 20px;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
}

form {
  margin-top: 20px;
}

label {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

input, button {
  padding: 5px 10px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

button {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

3. Customize the styles based on your design preferences. Adjust the font sizes, colors, paddings, margins, and other properties as needed.

### Step 3: Test the Main Section Design

1. Save your HTML and CSS files.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. Verify that the main section is displaying the "Create a New Itinerary" heading and the form with the desired form fields.
4. Test the responsiveness by resizing the browser window or using the browser's device emulation mode.

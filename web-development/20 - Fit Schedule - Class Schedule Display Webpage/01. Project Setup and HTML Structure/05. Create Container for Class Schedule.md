#### Task: Create a container element for the class schedule display section.

1. Open the "index.html" file that you created in the previous task.
2. Inside the `<body>` tag, add a `<div>` element to serve as the container for the class schedule display section. You can give it an `id` attribute to uniquely identify it.
   - Example code:

```html
<body>
    <div id="class-schedule-container">
        <!-- Class schedule display will go here -->
    </div>
</body>
```

Explanation:
- The `<div>` element is a block-level container used to group and style other HTML elements.
- The `id` attribute allows us to uniquely identify this `<div>` element. We have given it the value "class-schedule-container", but you can choose any meaningful name you prefer.

3. Save the file.

1. Ensure you have set up a backend server using a framework of your choice (e.g., Node.js with Express). If not, refer to the previous guide on setting up a backend server.

2. Open your preferred code editor and navigate to the project directory.

3. Create a new directory called `routes` within the project directory.

4. Inside the `routes` directory, create a new file called `bookings.js`.

5. Open the `bookings.js` file in your code editor.

6. Import the required modules and define the Express router:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();
   ```

7. Define a route to handle booking creation:
   ```javascript
   router.post('/bookings', (req, res) => {
     // Extract booking data from the request body
     const { userId, packageId, startDate, endDate } = req.body;
     
     // Validate the booking data
     // Perform necessary checks, such as checking for available slots, user authentication, etc.
     
     // If the booking data is valid, proceed with booking creation
     // Create a new booking record in the database
     
     // Send a success response
     res.status(200).json({ message: 'Booking created successfully!' });
   });
   ```

8. Define a route to retrieve booking details:
   ```javascript
   router.get('/bookings/:bookingId', (req, res) => {
     // Extract the booking ID from the request parameters
     const { bookingId } = req.params;
     
     // Retrieve the booking details from the database using the booking ID
     
     // If the booking is found, send the details as a response
     res.status(200).json({ booking });
     
     // If the booking is not found, send an error response
     res.status(404).json({ message: 'Booking not found' });
   });
   ```

9. Export the router:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = router;
   ```

10. Save the `bookings.js` file.

11. Open the `server.js` file (or the main file where your backend server is defined).

12. Import the `bookings` router at the top of the file:
    ```javascript
    const bookingsRouter = require('./routes/bookings');
    ```

13. Use the `bookings` router as middleware in your application:
    ```javascript
    app.use('/api', bookingsRouter);
    ```

14. Save the `server.js` file.

15. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

16. Start the backend server (if not already running) by running the following command:
    ```shell
    node server.js
    ```

17. Your backend server is now set up with the functionality to make a booking for a selected travel package. You can test this functionality by making a POST request to the `/api/bookings` endpoint with the required booking data. Additionally, you can retrieve booking details by making a GET request to the `/api/bookings/:bookingId` endpoint, where `:bookingId` should be replaced with the actual booking ID.

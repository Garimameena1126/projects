1. Open the HTML file where your product cards are located.

2. Locate the area within each product card where you want to add the "Add to Wishlist" button. This could be a specific `<div>`, `<span>`, or any other element that represents the product card.

3. Insert the following code snippet at the desired location within the product card element:

   ```html
   <button class="add-to-wishlist-button">Add to Wishlist</button>
   ```

   The code above adds a button element with the class name "add-to-wishlist-button" and the label "Add to Wishlist".

4. Save the HTML file.

5. Open the CSS file associated with your HTML file.

6. Add the following CSS code to style the "Add to Wishlist" button:

   ```css
   .add-to-wishlist-button {
     background-color: #f8f8f8;
     color: #333;
     border: 1px solid #ccc;
     padding: 5px 10px;
     cursor: pointer;
   }
   ```

   The CSS code above styles the button with a light background color, dark text color, border, padding, and a cursor pointer to indicate interactivity.

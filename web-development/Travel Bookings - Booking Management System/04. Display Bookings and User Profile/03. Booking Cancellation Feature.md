1. Ensure you have set up a frontend framework or library of your choice (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) and have a basic project structure in place. If not, refer to the documentation for your chosen framework to set up a new project.

2. Open the file where the booking information is displayed, such as the bookings page or user profile page.

3. Locate the section of code that renders the bookings list or booking history.

4. Inside the booking item component, add a button or link to allow users to cancel their bookings. For example, in React:
   ```jsx
   function BookingItem({ booking, onCancelBooking }) {
     return (
       <div>
         <h3>{booking.packageName}</h3>
         <p>Date: {booking.date}</p>
         {/* Add other booking details */}
         <button onClick={() => onCancelBooking(booking.id)}>Cancel Booking</button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   Adjust the JSX markup and styling based on your project's requirements.

5. In the parent component (e.g., bookings page or user profile page), define a function to handle the cancellation of a booking. This function should communicate with your backend server to cancel the booking and update the UI accordingly. For example, in React:
   ```jsx
   function BookingsPage() {
     // ...
     
     function handleCancelBooking(bookingId) {
       axios.delete(`/api/bookings/${bookingId}`)  // Adjust the API endpoint according to your server setup
         .then(response => {
           // Update the UI to reflect the cancellation
           // For example, remove the booking from the state or fetch updated booking data
         })
         .catch(error => {
           console.error('Error canceling booking:', error);
         });
     }
     
     // ...
   }
   ```

6. Pass the `handleCancelBooking` function as a prop to the `BookingItem` component when rendering the bookings list or booking history. For example:
   ```jsx
   {bookings.map(booking => (
     <BookingItem
       key={booking.id}
       booking={booking}
       onCancelBooking={handleCancelBooking}
     />
   ))}
   ```

   Adjust the iteration over bookings based on your project's data structure.

7. Save the file and ensure your frontend development server is running.

8. Test the cancellation feature by navigating to the bookings page or user profile page in your application. Locate a booking and click the "Cancel Booking" button or link. Verify that the cancellation request is sent to the server and the UI updates accordingly.

# Beginner's Guide: Customizing Shared Content for Reviews

In this guide, we will learn how to customize shared content when implementing social media sharing functionality for reviews. We will focus on adding review details and product information to the shared content. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to customize the shared content in your application.

## Step 1: Identify Review Details and Product Information

1. Determine the specific review details and product information that you want to include in the shared content. This could include elements such as the review text, reviewer's name, product name, product image, rating, etc.

2. Decide how you want to format and present this information in the shared content. For example, you might want to include the review text as a quote or add it as a caption along with the product image.

## Step 2: Access Review Data

1. Ensure that you have access to the necessary review data in your application. This data could be stored in a database or retrieved from an external source.

2. Retrieve the review data based on the specific review that is being shared. For example, if you have a review ID or reference, fetch the corresponding review data from your data source.

## Step 3: Generate Customized Shared Content

1. Use the review data to generate the customized shared content. This can be done by manipulating the data and formatting it in a way that suits your requirements.

2. Concatenate the different elements of the shared content, such as the review text, reviewer's name, product name, etc., into a single string or HTML markup.

3. Ensure that the shared content adheres to the guidelines and limitations imposed by the social media platforms you are integrating with. For example, some platforms have character limits or specific image size requirements.

## Step 4: Integrate Customized Content into Social Media Sharing

1. Identify the point in your application where the sharing action is triggered. This could be a button click event or a form submission event.

2. Pass the customized shared content to the social media sharing API or SDK you are using. This may involve modifying your existing code to include the additional parameters or data.

## Step 5: Test and Verify the Customization

1. Run your application and navigate to the page where the social media sharing functionality is available.

2. Trigger the sharing action and verify that the customized shared content appears correctly on the social media platform.

3. Ensure that the review details and product information are accurately included in the shared content.

Congratulations! You have successfully customized the shared content to include review details and product information. Users can now share reviews from your application with a personalized touch. Remember to handle any error cases and provide appropriate feedback to users when sharing actions are performed.

Note: The specific implementation details and code may vary depending on the social media platform APIs or SDKs you are using. Refer to the documentation provided by the platform for the correct usage and parameters for customizing shared content.

Example:

Suppose you have the following review data:

- Review Text: "This product is amazing!"
- Reviewer's Name: "John Doe"
- Product Name: "SuperGadget X1000"
- Product Image URL: "https://example.com/images/supergadget.jpg"
- Rating: 4.5 stars

To customize the shared content, you can format it as follows:

```
Review: "This product is amazing!"
- By John Doe

Product: SuperGadget X1000
Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐✩
```

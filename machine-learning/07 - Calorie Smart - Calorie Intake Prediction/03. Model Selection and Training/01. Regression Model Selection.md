## Module 3: Model Selection and Training

In this task, we will select an appropriate regression model for calorie intake prediction. We have several options to choose from, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or Neural Network. Let's explore each model and understand their suitability for our project.

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

Before we proceed, let's import the necessary libraries for our model selection and training task.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
```

### Step 2: Load Preprocessed Data

Assuming you have already completed the data preprocessing and feature engineering step, we can now load the preprocessed data into our program.

```python
# Load the preprocessed dataset
data = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_data.csv')

# Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y)
X = data.drop('calorie_intake', axis=1)
y = data['calorie_intake']
```

### Step 3: Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

To assess the performance of our selected regression model, we need to split the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 4: Model Selection

Now that our data is prepared, we can proceed with selecting the regression model for calorie intake prediction. Let's explore the suitability of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network models for our task.

#### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a simple and widely used model for predicting continuous target variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

```python
# Create a Linear Regression model
linear_model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model on the training data
linear_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Decision Tree Regression

Decision Tree Regression is a non-linear model that splits the feature space into regions and assigns a constant value to each region. It can capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.

```python
# Create a Decision Tree Regression model
tree_model = DecisionTreeRegressor()

# Train the model on the training data
tree_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Neural Network Regression

Neural Network Regression utilizes an artificial neural network with hidden layers to learn complex patterns in the data. It can capture non-linear relationships and perform well for tasks with large amounts of data.

```python
# Create a Neural Network Regression model
nn_model = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 100), activation='relu', random_state=42)

# Train the model on the training data
nn_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Step 5: Model Evaluation

After training the models, we need to evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics. Let's calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for each model and compare the results.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

# Evaluate Linear Regression model
linear_predictions = linear_model.predict(X_test)
linear_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, linear_predictions)
linear_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, linear_predictions, squared=False)
print("Linear Regression Performance:")
print("MAE:", linear_mae)
print("RMSE:", linear_rmse)

# Evaluate Decision Tree Regression

 model
tree_predictions = tree_model.predict(X_test)
tree_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, tree_predictions)
tree_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, tree_predictions, squared=False)
print("Decision Tree Regression Performance:")
print("MAE:", tree_mae)
print("RMSE:", tree_rmse)

# Evaluate Neural Network Regression model
nn_predictions = nn_model.predict(X_test)
nn_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, nn_predictions)
nn_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, nn_predictions, squared=False)
print("Neural Network Regression Performance:")
print("MAE:", nn_mae)
print("RMSE:", nn_rmse)
```

### Step 6: Model Comparison and Selection

Based on the evaluation metrics, we can compare the performance of each model and choose the one that provides the best results for our calorie intake prediction task. Lower values of MAE and RMSE indicate better model performance.

After evaluating the models, consider factors such as simplicity, interpretability, and computational complexity to make an informed decision about the most suitable model for your project.

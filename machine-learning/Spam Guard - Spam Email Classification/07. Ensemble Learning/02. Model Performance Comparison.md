# Comparing Ensemble Model Performance with Individual Models

In this guide, we will compare the performance of an ensemble model with the individual models used in the previous tasks of our email classification project. Ensemble learning combines multiple base models to make predictions, potentially leading to improved performance. We will use ensemble techniques such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting and evaluate their performance against the individual models.

## Step 1: Import Required Libraries

Before we proceed, let's import the necessary libraries for implementing ensemble models and evaluating their performance.

```python
# Import required libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
```

## Step 2: Load the Dataset

Load the preprocessed dataset that we have obtained from the previous tasks. Ensure that the dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

```python
# Load the preprocessed dataset
# Assuming 'X_train', 'y_train' are the features and labels of the training set
# Assuming 'X_test', 'y_test' are the features and labels of the testing set
```

## Step 3: Train Individual Models

Train the individual models that were used in the previous tasks. For example, if we had previously trained a Naive Bayes model and a Support Vector Machines model, we would train those models again.

```python
# Train individual models
# Assuming 'naive_bayes_model' is the Naive Bayes model
naive_bayes_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Assuming 'svm_model' is the Support Vector Machines model
svm_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 4: Train Ensemble Model

Now, let's train an ensemble model using the ensemble learning techniques such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting. We will combine the predictions from multiple base models to make the final prediction.

### 4.1 Random Forests

```python
# Train Random Forests ensemble model
random_forest_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
random_forest_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 4.2 Gradient Boosting

```python
# Train Gradient Boosting ensemble model
gradient_boosting_model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
gradient_boosting_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 5: Evaluate Model Performance

Now that we have trained the individual models and the ensemble model, let's evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 5.1 Individual Models

```python
# Evaluate Naive Bayes model
naive_bayes_predictions = naive_bayes_model.predict(X_test)
naive_bayes_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, naive_bayes_predictions)
naive_bayes_precision = precision_score(y_test, naive_bayes_predictions)
naive_bayes_recall = recall_score(y_test, naive_bayes_predictions)

# Evaluate Support Vector Machines model
svm_predictions = svm_model.predict(X_test)
svm_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, svm_predictions)
svm_precision = precision_score(y_test, svm_predictions)
svm_recall = recall_score(y_test, svm_predictions)
```

### 5.2 Ensemble Model

```python
# Evaluate Random Forests ensemble model
random_forest_predictions = random_forest_model.predict(X_test)
random_forest_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, random_forest_predictions)
random_forest_precision = precision_score(y_test, random_forest_predictions)
random_forest_recall = recall_score(y_test, random_forest_predictions)

# Evaluate Gradient Boosting ensemble model
gradient

_boosting_predictions = gradient_boosting_model.predict(X_test)
gradient_boosting_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, gradient_boosting_predictions)
gradient_boosting_precision = precision_score(y_test, gradient_boosting_predictions)
gradient_boosting_recall = recall_score(y_test, gradient_boosting_predictions)
```

## Step 6: Compare Model Performance

Finally, let's compare the performance of the individual models and the ensemble models by analyzing the evaluation metrics obtained in the previous step.

```python
# Compare model performance
print("Individual Models:")
print("Naive Bayes - Accuracy:", naive_bayes_accuracy, "Precision:", naive_bayes_precision, "Recall:", naive_bayes_recall)
print("Support Vector Machines - Accuracy:", svm_accuracy, "Precision:", svm_precision, "Recall:", svm_recall)

print("\nEnsemble Models:")
print("Random Forests - Accuracy:", random_forest_accuracy, "Precision:", random_forest_precision, "Recall:", random_forest_recall)
print("Gradient Boosting - Accuracy:", gradient_boosting_accuracy, "Precision:", gradient_boosting_precision, "Recall:", gradient_boosting_recall)
```

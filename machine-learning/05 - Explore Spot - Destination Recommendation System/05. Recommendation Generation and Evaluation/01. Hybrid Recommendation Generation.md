In this guide, we will walk through the process of generating recommendations for users using a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods. This approach combines the strengths of both methods to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations.

### Step 1: Load the Data

The first step is to load the necessary data for the recommendation system. This may include user preferences, item attributes, and any other relevant information. For example, let's assume we have a dataset containing user ratings for different travel destinations.

```python
# Load the data
import pandas as pd

ratings_data = pd.read_csv('ratings.csv')
destinations_data = pd.read_csv('destinations.csv')
```

### Step 2: Preprocess the Data

Before applying collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, it's important to preprocess the data to ensure it is in the proper format for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

```python
# Preprocess the data
# Handle missing values
ratings_data = ratings_data.dropna()

# Encode categorical variables (if any)
# Normalize numerical features (if required)
```

### Step 3: Implement Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering relies on user-item interactions to generate recommendations. There are two common approaches to collaborative filtering: user-based and item-based.

#### User-Based Collaborative Filtering

User-based collaborative filtering identifies similar users based on their preferences and generates recommendations based on items liked by similar users.

```python
# Implement user-based collaborative filtering
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def user_based_collaborative_filtering(user_id, ratings_data):
    # Select ratings of the target user
    target_user_ratings = ratings_data[ratings_data['user_id'] == user_id]

    # Calculate similarity between target user and all other users
    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(target_user_ratings, ratings_data)

    # Identify similar users
    similar_users = similarity_scores.argsort()[0][-5:]

    # Generate recommendations based on items liked by similar users
    recommendations = ratings_data[ratings_data['user_id'].isin(similar_users)]['item_id'].unique()

    return recommendations
```

#### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Item-based collaborative filtering identifies similar items based on their user ratings and generates recommendations based on items similar to those liked by the user.

```python
# Implement item-based collaborative filtering
def item_based_collaborative_filtering(user_id, ratings_data):
    # Select ratings of the target user
    target_user_ratings = ratings_data[ratings_data['user_id'] == user_id]

    # Calculate similarity between items based on user ratings
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(target_user_ratings.T)

    # Identify similar items
    similar_items = similarity_matrix.argsort()[0][-5:]

    # Generate recommendations based on similar items
    recommendations = ratings_data[ratings_data['item_id'].isin(similar_items)]['item_id'].unique()

    return recommendations
```

### Step 4: Implement Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering recommends items based on their attributes and the user's preferences. It calculates the similarity between the user's preferences and the attributes of the items.

```python
# Implement content-based filtering
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel

def content_based_filtering(user_preferences, destinations_data):
    # Transform destination attributes into a feature matrix
    tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    destination_features = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(destinations_data['attributes'])

    # Calculate similarity

 between user preferences and destination attributes
    similarity_scores = linear_kernel(user_preferences, destination_features)

    # Identify similar destinations
    similar_destinations = similarity_scores.argsort()[0][-5:]

    # Generate recommendations based on similar destinations
    recommendations = destinations_data.iloc[similar_destinations]['destination_name']

    return recommendations
```

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations

Now that we have implemented both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, we can generate recommendations by combining the results from both methods.

```python
# Generate recommendations
user_id = 123  # Example user ID

user_preferences = preprocess_user_preferences(user_id)  # Preprocess user preferences if required

# Generate collaborative filtering recommendations
collaborative_filtering_recommendations = user_based_collaborative_filtering(user_id, ratings_data)

# Generate content-based filtering recommendations
content_based_filtering_recommendations = content_based_filtering(user_preferences, destinations_data)

# Combine recommendations from both methods
combined_recommendations = collaborative_filtering_recommendations + content_based_filtering_recommendations

print(combined_recommendations)
```

### Step 6: Evaluate the Performance

To evaluate the performance of the recommendation system, we need to use appropriate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or mean average precision. These metrics measure the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations compared to the ground truth.

```python
# Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system
# Implement the evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, MAP) based on ground truth data

```

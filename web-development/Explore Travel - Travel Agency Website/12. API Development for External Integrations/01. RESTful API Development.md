#  Developing a RESTful API for External Integrations

In this guide, we will walk through the steps to develop a RESTful API that exposes travel agency data to external applications. RESTful APIs provide a standardized way for different systems to communicate and exchange data. We will follow a step-by-step approach to build the API. Let's get started:

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

1. Create a new directory for your API project.

2. Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`. This will create a `package.json` file that tracks project dependencies.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
    ```shell
    npm install express body-parser
    ```

4. Create a new file called `server.js` to serve as the entry point for your API.

5. Open `server.js` in a text editor and import the required modules:
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    ```

6. Create an instance of the Express application:
    ```javascript
    const app = express();
    ```

## Step 2: Define API Endpoints

1. Define the API endpoints for retrieving travel agency data. For example, you may have endpoints to retrieve destinations, packages, and testimonials.

2. Define the necessary HTTP methods for each endpoint. Typically, GET requests are used for retrieving data.

3. Implement the route handlers for each endpoint. These functions will be executed when a request is made to the corresponding endpoint.

    Here's an example of defining an endpoint to retrieve destinations:
    ```javascript
    app.get('/destinations', (req, res) => {
      // Logic to retrieve destinations from the database or other data source
      // Send the retrieved data as the API response
      res.json(destinations);
    });
    ```

## Step 3: Implement Authentication and Access Control

1. Decide on the authentication mechanism for your API. Common approaches include API keys, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or OAuth.

2. Implement the necessary middleware to handle authentication and access control. This middleware should be executed before the route handlers.

    Here's an example of implementing a basic API key authentication middleware:
    ```javascript
    const apiKeyMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
      const apiKey = req.headers['x-api-key'];
    
      if (apiKey === process.env.API_KEY) {
        next(); // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
      } else {
        res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
      }
    };
    
    // Apply the middleware to all API endpoints
    app.use(apiKeyMiddleware);
    ```

## Step 4: Document the API

1. Documenting the API helps developers understand how to interact with it. There are various tools available for API documentation, such as Swagger or Postman.

2. Choose a documentation tool that suits your needs and follow its instructions for documenting your API endpoints, request/response structures, and any additional information.

## Step 5: Start the API Server

1. Add the following code at the end of `server.js` to start the API server:
    ```javascript
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`API server listening on port ${port}`);
    });
    ```

2. Save the changes to `server.js`.

3. Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to start the API server:
    ```shell
    node server.js
    ```


## Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

Before we start training the model, let's import the necessary libraries that we'll be using:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
```

In this guide, we'll use `pandas` library for data manipulation, `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` to split the data, `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model` as the selected regression model, and `mean_absolute_error` from `sklearn.metrics` to evaluate the model's performance.

## Step 2: Load the preprocessed data

Assuming you have already preprocessed the data in the previous module, we'll now load the preprocessed dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Make sure the dataset contains the features and target variable required for calorie intake prediction.

```python
# Load the preprocessed data into a DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_data.csv')

# Separate the features (X) and target variable (y)
X = data.drop('calorie_intake', axis=1)
y = data['calorie_intake']
```

Replace `'preprocessed_data.csv'` with the actual filename/path of your preprocessed dataset.

## Step 3: Split the data into training and testing sets

To train the model, we need to split the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

In this example, we are splitting the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Adjust the `test_size` parameter based on your preference.

## Step 4: Initialize and train the regression model

Now, we can initialize the selected regression model and train it using the training data.

```python
# Initialize the regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Here, we are using `LinearRegression` as the selected regression model. Feel free to replace it with the appropriate model based on your choice.

## Step 5: Evaluate the model's performance

Once the model is trained, we can evaluate its performance using the testing set. Let's calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) as the evaluation metric in this example.

```python
# Make predictions on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean absolute error (MAE)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", mae)
```

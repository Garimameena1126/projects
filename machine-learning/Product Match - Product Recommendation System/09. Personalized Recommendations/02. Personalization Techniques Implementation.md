In this task, we will enhance the recommendation system by utilizing user profile information, such as demographic data or past purchase behavior. By considering user-specific data, we can provide personalized recommendations that cater to individual preferences and needs.

### Step 1: Collect User Profile Information

To begin, we need to collect user profile information that can be used to personalize the recommendations. This information may include demographic data (e.g., age, gender, location) and past purchase behavior (e.g., previous purchases, browsing history). 

Here's an example of how to collect user profile information using a web form:

```html
<!-- HTML form to collect user profile information -->
<form>
  <label for="age">Age:</label>
  <input type="number" id="age" name="age">

  <label for="gender">Gender:</label>
  <select id="gender" name="gender">
    <option value="male">Male</option>
    <option value="female">Female</option>
    <option value="other">Other</option>
  </select>

  <label for="location">Location:</label>
  <input type="text" id="location" name="location">

  <!-- Additional fields for past purchase behavior -->

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

Make sure to handle the form submission and store the user profile information in a suitable format (e.g., database, CSV file) for future use.

### Step 2: Incorporate User Profile Data into Recommendation Algorithm

Next, we need to modify the recommendation algorithm to incorporate user profile data and personalize the recommendations accordingly. This can be achieved by considering user preferences and aligning them with the available product attributes.

Here's an example of how to incorporate user profile data into a content-based recommendation algorithm:

```python
# Assuming user_profile contains the collected user profile information
user_profile = {
  'age': 25,
  'gender': 'male',
  'location': 'New York'
}

# Calculate similarity between user profile and product attributes
def calculate_similarity(user_profile, product_attributes):
  # Implement similarity calculation logic here
  pass

# Generate personalized recommendations based on user profile
def generate_personalized_recommendations(user_profile, products):
  recommendations = []
  
  for product in products:
    similarity_score = calculate_similarity(user_profile, product.attributes)
    recommendations.append((product, similarity_score))
  
  # Sort recommendations based on similarity score
  recommendations.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  
  return recommendations
```

Ensure that the `calculate_similarity()` function is implemented based on your chosen similarity metric and the available user profile and product attributes.

### Step 3: Display Personalized Recommendations

Finally, we need to update the recommendation display to show personalized recommendations based on the user profile information. This can be achieved by retrieving the personalized recommendations generated in the previous step and presenting them to the user.

Here's an example of how to display personalized recommendations on a website:

```html
<!-- HTML code to display personalized recommendations -->
<h2>Personalized Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  {% for product, similarity_score in personalized_recommendations %}
    <li>{{ product.name }} (Similarity Score: {{ similarity_score }})</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

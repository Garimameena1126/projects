### Prerequisites
Before starting with the development of the command-line application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Python installed on your system
- Required libraries installed, such as scikit-learn for machine learning, pandas for data manipulation, and numpy for numerical computations

### 1. Set Up the Project Structure
Start by creating a project directory where you'll store all the necessary files for your command-line application. Open your terminal and follow these steps:
1. Create a new directory for your project: `mkdir calorie_intake_prediction`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd calorie_intake_prediction`
3. Create the following subdirectories within the project directory:
   - `data`: for storing the dataset and trained model
   - `src`: for storing the source code of the command-line application

### 2. Prepare the Dataset and Trained Model
To predict calorie intake, you'll need a trained machine learning model and a dataset for testing. In this guide, we assume that you have already completed the previous modules and have a trained model available. Follow these steps to prepare the dataset and trained model for the command-line application:
1. Copy the trained model file (e.g., `calorie_intake_model.pkl`) into the `data` directory.
2. Copy the dataset file (e.g., `user_data.csv`) into the `data` directory. Ensure that the dataset contains the necessary input features and corresponding calorie intake values.

### 3. Create the Command-Line Application
Now it's time to create the command-line application that will allow users to input their details and predict their calorie intake. Follow these steps to create the application:

1. Open your preferred code editor or IDE and create a new file in the `src` directory. Name it `calorie_prediction_app.py`.

2. Import the necessary libraries at the beginning of the `calorie_prediction_app.py` file:
```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd
```

3. Load the trained model and the dataset within the application:
```python
# Load the trained model
with open('data/calorie_intake_model.pkl', 'rb') as model_file:
    model = pickle.load(model_file)

# Load the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('data/user_data.csv')
```

4. Define a function that takes user inputs, processes them, and predicts the calorie intake using the trained model:
```python
def predict_calorie_intake(user_inputs):
    # Preprocess user inputs and transform them into the required format for prediction
    user_data = pd.DataFrame(user_inputs, index=[0])

    # Make predictions using the trained model
    predicted_calorie_intake = model.predict(user_data)

    return predicted_calorie_intake[0]
```

5. Implement the main logic of the command-line application by continuously prompting users for input and displaying the predicted calorie intake:
```python
while True:
    print("=== Calorie Intake Prediction ===")
    print("Enter your details:")
    age = int(input("Age (years): "))
    gender = input("Gender (M/F): ")
    weight = float(input("Weight (kg): "))
    height = float(input("Height (cm): "))
    activity_level = input("Activity Level (Low/Medium/High): ")
    dietary_info = input("Dietary Information: ")

    # Prepare user inputs as a dictionary


    user_inputs = {
        'age': age,
        'gender': gender,
        'weight': weight,
        'height': height,
        'activity_level': activity_level,
        'dietary_info': dietary_info
    }

    # Predict the calorie intake based on user inputs
    predicted_intake = predict_calorie_intake(user_inputs)

    print(f"Predicted Calorie Intake: {predicted_intake} calories\n")

    # Ask the user if they want to make another prediction or exit
    choice = input("Enter 'Q' to quit or any other key to make another prediction: ")
    if choice.upper() == 'Q':
        break
```

6. Save the `calorie_prediction_app.py` file.

### 4. Run the Command-Line Application
To run the command-line application, follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory: `cd calorie_intake_prediction/src`
2. Execute the command: `python calorie_prediction_app.py`
3. The application will prompt you to enter your details, and it will display the predicted calorie intake based on your inputs.
4. You can continue making predictions or exit the application when prompted.

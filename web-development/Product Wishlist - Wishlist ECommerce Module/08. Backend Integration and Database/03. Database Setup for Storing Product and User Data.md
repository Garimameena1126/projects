1. Install MongoDB on your system by following the official installation guide for your operating system. You can download MongoDB from the official website: [https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/)

2. Once MongoDB is installed, start the MongoDB server by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   mongod
   ```

   This will start the MongoDB server and it will listen for database connections on the default port (27017).

3. Open a new terminal or command prompt window and start the MongoDB shell by running the following command:
   ```
   mongo
   ```

   This will open the MongoDB shell where you can interact with the database.

4. Create a new database by running the following command in the MongoDB shell:
   ```
   use mydatabase
   ```

   Replace `mydatabase` with the name you want to give to your database.

5. Create collections for storing product and user data by running the following commands:
   ```javascript
   db.createCollection('products')
   db.createCollection('users')
   ```

   This will create two collections named `products` and `users` in your database.

6. Define the structure of the `products` collection by inserting a sample document. Run the following command:
   ```javascript
   db.products.insertOne({
     name: 'Sample Product',
     price: 9.99,
     description: 'This is a sample product.'
   })
   ```

   This will insert a sample document into the `products` collection with some sample data.

7. Define the structure of the `users` collection by inserting a sample document. Run the following command:
   ```javascript
   db.users.insertOne({
     name: 'John Doe',
     email: 'johndoe@example.com',
     password: 'mypassword'
   })
   ```

   This will insert a sample document into the `users` collection with some sample data.

8. Verify that the data has been successfully inserted into the collections by running the following commands:
   ```javascript
   db.products.find().pretty()
   db.users.find().pretty()
   ```

   This will retrieve and display the documents stored in the `products` and `users` collections.

9. Close the MongoDB shell by running the following command:
   ```
   exit
   ```

   This will exit the MongoDB shell.

10. In your server-side code (e.g., Node.js with Express), connect to the MongoDB database using a MongoDB driver or an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library like Mongoose.

   - If you're using the official MongoDB driver, install it by running the following command:
     ```
     npm install mongodb
     ```

     Here's an example code snippet to connect to the MongoDB database using the MongoDB driver:
     ```javascript
     const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

     // Connection URL
     const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

     // Database Name
     const dbName = 'mydatabase';

     // Create a new MongoClient
     const client = new MongoClient(url);

     // Connect to the MongoDB server
     client.connect(function(err) {
       if (err) {
         console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', err);
       } else {
         console.log('Connected successfully to MongoDB');

         // Access the database
         const db = client.db(dbName);

         // Perform database operations here

         // Close the MongoDB connection
         client.close();
       }
     });
     ```

   - If you're using Mongoose, install it by running the following command:
     ```
     npm install mongoose
     ```

     Here's an example code snippet to connect to the MongoDB database using Mongoose:
     ```javascript
     const mongoose = require('mongoose');

     // Connection URL
     const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase';

     // Connect to the MongoDB server
     mongoose.connect(url, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
       .then(() => {
         console.log('Connected successfully to MongoDB');

         // Perform database operations here

         // Disconnect from the MongoDB server
         mongoose.disconnect();
       })
       .catch((err) => {
         console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', err);
       });
     ```

   Replace `mydatabase` with the name of your MongoDB database.

11. With the database connection established, you can now perform various database operations such as inserting, updating, retrieving, and deleting data using the appropriate methods provided by the MongoDB driver or Mongoose.

   Here's an example code snippet using Mongoose to retrieve all products from the `products` collection:
   ```javascript
   const Product = require('./models/product'); // Assuming you have a Product model defined

   // Retrieve all products
   Product.find()
     .then((products) => {
       console.log('Retrieved products:', products);
     })
     .catch((err) => {
       console.error('Error retrieving products:', err);
     });
   ```

   Adjust the code according to your project's specific requirements.

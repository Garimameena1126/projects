# Documenting API Functionality using Swagger

In this guide, we will focus on documenting the functionality of your RESTful API using Swagger. Swagger is a popular tool for documenting APIs, providing a standardized format for describing endpoints, parameters, responses, and more. Follow the step-by-step process below to document your API using Swagger.

## Step 1: Install Swagger Tools

1. Open your project directory in a terminal or command prompt.

2. Install the necessary Swagger tools. One popular option is `swagger-ui-express` for Node.js projects.

   Example:
   ```shell
   npm install swagger-ui-express
   ```

## Step 2: Create a Swagger Specification File

1. Create a new file, such as `swagger.yaml` or `swagger.json`, in your project's directory.

2. Define the basic structure of the Swagger specification file. This includes information about your API, such as its title, version, and description.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   swagger: "2.0"
   info:
     title: My Travel Agency API
     version: 1.0.0
     description: API documentation for the Travel Agency project
   ```

3. Define the paths and endpoints of your API, along with their corresponding HTTP methods, parameters, and responses.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   paths:
     /destinations:
       get:
         summary: Retrieve all destinations
         responses:
           '200':
             description: Successful response
             schema:
               type: array
               items:
                 $ref: '#/definitions/Destination'
     /packages:
       get:
         summary: Retrieve all packages
         responses:
           '200':
             description: Successful response
             schema:
               type: array
               items:
                 $ref: '#/definitions/Package'
   ```

4. Define data models or schema definitions for the objects used in your API.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   definitions:
     Destination:
       type: object
       properties:
         id:
           type: integer
         name:
           type: string
         ...
     Package:
       type: object
       properties:
         id:
           type: integer
         name:
           type: string
         ...
   ```

## Step 3: Generate Swagger Documentation

1. Import the necessary packages in your API server file (e.g., `server.js`).

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express');
   const swaggerDocument = require('./swagger.json');
   ```

2. Create a route to serve the Swagger UI and the generated documentation.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const app = express();

   app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));
   ```

3. Save the changes to your files.

4. Start your API server.

5. Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where your API is running, followed by `/api-docs`. This will display the Swagger UI with the generated documentation.

6. Explore the API endpoints, parameters, and responses in the Swagger UI to understand the functionality of your API.

## Step 4: Update Swagger Documentation as Needed

1. Whenever you make changes to your API, update the Swagger specification file (`swagger.yaml` or `swagger.json`) to reflect those changes.

2. Regenerate the Swagger documentation by restarting your API server.

3. Verify that the Swagger UI now reflects the updated API functionality.

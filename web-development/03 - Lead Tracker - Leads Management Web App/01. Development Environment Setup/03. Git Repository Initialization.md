To track changes and manage version control for your web development project, you need to initialize a Git repository in your project directory. This guide will walk you through the process:

#### Step 1: Open the Terminal or Command Prompt

First, open the terminal or command prompt on your computer. This will allow you to execute commands necessary to initialize the Git repository.

#### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory. This is the directory where you have created your web development project. For example, if your project directory is located on the desktop, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/lead-management-system
```

Replace `lead-management-system` with the name of your project directory.

#### Step 3: Initialize the Git Repository

Once you are inside the project directory, you can initialize the Git repository by running the following command:

```bash
git init
```

This command initializes an empty Git repository in your project directory. You should see an output similar to the following:

```bash
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/your/project-directory/.git/
```

Congratulations! You have successfully initialized a Git repository in your project directory.

#### Step 4: Verify the Git Repository

To verify that the Git repository was initialized correctly, you can use the `git status` command. This command shows the current status of your repository and any untracked files.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git status
```

If everything was set up correctly, you should see a message indicating that you are on the `main` (or `master`) branch and that there are no untracked files.

```bash
On branch main
No commits yet
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

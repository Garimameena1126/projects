1. Research and select a suitable load balancer solution that aligns with your technology stack. Some popular options include Nginx, HAProxy, and Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

2. Install and configure the load balancer according to the documentation provided for your chosen solution.

## Step 2: Configure Load Balancer

1. Determine the routing algorithm for your load balancer. Common algorithms include Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash.

2. Set up your load balancer to listen on a specific port or ports and forward incoming requests to your application servers.

3. Configure health checks to monitor the health of your application servers. This ensures that traffic is directed only to healthy servers.

## Step 3: Set Up Additional Application Servers

1. Provision additional servers or instances to handle the increased traffic.

2. Install and configure your application on the newly provisioned servers. Ensure that the application is set up to communicate with the shared database and any other necessary dependencies.

3. Ensure that each server runs the same version of the application code and has the necessary configurations to connect to the load balancer.

## Step 4: Test Load Balancer Configuration

1. Start the load balancer and verify that it routes incoming requests to the available application servers.

2. Perform load testing to simulate high traffic and measure the performance and scalability of your application.

## Step 5: Monitor and Scale

1. Monitor the performance and resource utilization of your application servers and load balancer. Use monitoring tools to track metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and request latency.

2. Set up alerts to notify you of any issues or when certain thresholds are exceeded.

3. As your traffic grows, monitor the performance of your application and determine if additional servers are required. If necessary, repeat Step 3 to provision and configure additional application servers.

4. Adjust the load balancer configuration and fine-tune the routing algorithm based on the observed traffic patterns and performance metrics.

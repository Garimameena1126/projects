# Implementing API Requests from the Frontend to Retrieve Order Details

In this task, we will implement API requests from the frontend to retrieve order details from the backend. This will allow us to fetch data from the server and display it in the frontend UI. Follow the steps below to implement API requests and retrieve order details.

## Step 1: Set Up the Frontend Environment

1. Ensure that the frontend project is set up and running. This includes having a working directory with the necessary files for your frontend framework or library (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the frontend project directory.

3. Install any required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

4. Start the frontend development server by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the frontend application and make it accessible at a specified URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Step 2: Define API Endpoint for Retrieving Order Details

1. In your backend project, define an API endpoint for retrieving order details. This endpoint should handle the HTTP GET request from the frontend.

   For example, using Node.js with Express, define the endpoint in your server file (`server.js` or equivalent) as follows:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Define API endpoint for retrieving order details
   app.get('/api/orders', (req, res) => {
     // Logic to retrieve order details from the database
     // Send the order details as a response
   });
   ```

   Adjust the endpoint URL (`/api/orders`) and the logic inside the route handler based on your backend implementation and data retrieval mechanism.

## Step 3: Make API Request from the Frontend

1. In your frontend project, open the component or file where you want to retrieve order details (e.g., `OrderList.js`).

2. Import the necessary libraries for making HTTP requests. For example, if using React with the `axios` library, add the following import statement at the top of your file:

   ```javascript
   import axios from 'axios';
   ```

3. Use the `axios` library (or any other library of your choice) to make an API request to retrieve order details. Here's an example of making a GET request to the backend API endpoint:

   ```javascript
   // Inside a React component
   componentDidMount() {
     axios
       .get('http://localhost:8000/api/orders')
       .then((response) => {
         const orders = response.data;
         // Handle the retrieved order details
       })
       .catch((error) => {
         // Handle errors
       });
   }
   ```

   Adjust the URL (`http://localhost:8000/api/orders`) based on your backend API endpoint and the route you defined in the previous step.

4. Within the `.then()` method, you can access the retrieved data from the backend through the `response.data` property. Handle the data based on your application's requirements. For example, you can update the component's state or pass the data as props to child components.

5. In the case of errors, handle them inside the `.catch()` method. You can display error messages to the user or perform any other necessary actions.

## Step 4: Display the Retrieved Data in the Frontend UI

1. Within your frontend component, use the retrieved order details to display the data in the UI. This can be done by accessing the component's state or props, depending on your application's architecture

.

2. Update the JSX code in your component's render method to display the order details. Use the retrieved data to generate dynamic content.

   For example, in a React component's render method:

   ```javascript
   render() {
     const { orders } = this.state;

     return (
       <div>
         {orders.map((order) => (
           <div key={order.id}>
             <p>Order ID: {order.id}</p>
             <p>Customer Name: {order.customerName}</p>
             {/* Display other order details */}
           </div>
         ))}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   Adjust the JSX code based on your specific UI requirements and the structure of your retrieved order details.

3. Save the file and ensure that the frontend development server is still running. Visit the frontend application in your web browser and verify that the retrieved order details are displayed correctly.

1. Open your preferred code editor.

2. Navigate to your project's directory and locate the HTML file where you want to create the homepage layout. If you don't have an existing HTML file, create a new one and name it `index.html`.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your code editor.

4. Start by adding the basic structure of an HTML document. Include the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>` element, and `<head>` and `<body>` sections. Your code should look like this:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>Tech Enabled Travel Agency</title>
       <!-- Add any CSS files or stylesheets here -->
     </head>
     <body>
       <!-- Your content will go here -->
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

5. Within the `<body>` section, create a `<header>` element to contain the navigation menu. Inside the `<header>` element, add a `<nav>` element and include the navigation links. For example:

   ```html
   <header>
     <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">Travel Packages</a></li>
         <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
       </ul>
     </nav>
   </header>
   ```

   Customize the navigation links and add appropriate URLs as needed.

6. After the `<header>` section, add the main content of the homepage. This can include a welcome message, featured travel packages, or any other content you'd like to display. Use appropriate HTML elements to structure the content.

   ```html
   <main>
     <h1>Welcome to Tech Enabled Travel Agency</h1>
     <p>Discover your dream destinations and plan your next adventure with us.</p>
     <!-- Add more content here -->
   </main>
   ```

   Customize the content according to your project requirements.

7. To create a footer, add a `<footer>` element after the main content. Inside the `<footer>` element, include any relevant information or links you want to display. For example:

   ```html
   <footer>
     <p>&copy; 2023 Tech Enabled Travel Agency. All rights reserved.</p>
     <p>Terms of Service | Privacy Policy</p>
   </footer>
   ```

   Customize the footer content as needed.

8. Save the `index.html` file.

9. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to preview the homepage layout. Verify that the navigation menu and footer are displayed correctly.

# Sending Order Related Email Notifications to Customers
## Step 1: Choose an Email Service Provider

1. Research and select a suitable email service provider that meets your project requirements. Some popular options include SendGrid, Nodemailer, and Amazon SES.

2. Sign up for an account with the chosen email service provider and obtain the necessary credentials/API keys.

## Step 2: Install and Set Up the Email Service Library

1. Install the email service library or package for your chosen provider. For example, if you're using Nodemailer with Node.js, you can install it using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install nodemailer
   ```

2. Set up the email service library by configuring it with the credentials/API keys obtained from the email service provider. This typically involves providing the SMTP server details, username, password, and other required configuration parameters.

## Step 3: Create Email Templates

1. Design and create the email templates that will be used for order-related notifications. Consider including dynamic placeholders for order details, such as order ID, status, and customer information.

2. Save the email templates as HTML files or define them as strings within your codebase.

## Step 4: Implement the Function to Send Email Notifications

1. In your application code, create a function that handles sending email notifications. This function should take input parameters such as the recipient's email address, subject, and body content.

2. Use the email service library to send the email using the configured email service provider. Pass the necessary parameters to the library's send function, including the recipient's email address, subject, and HTML content of the email template.

   Example using Nodemailer:

   ```javascript
   const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

   async function sendEmailNotification(recipient, subject, htmlContent) {
     const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
       /* Configure the transporter with your email service provider details */
     });

     const mailOptions = {
       from: 'your-email@example.com',
       to: recipient,
       subject: subject,
       html: htmlContent,
     };

     await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);
   }
   ```

## Step 5: Update the Order Status and Trigger Email Notifications

1. Implement the functionality to update the order status in your application. This could involve updating the status field in the database or making API calls to the backend.

2. Once the order status is updated, call the sendEmailNotification function and provide the recipient's email address, subject, and the HTML content of the email template. You can include the updated order status and any other relevant order details in the email content.

   Example usage:

   ```javascript
   const recipientEmail = 'customer@example.com';
   const subject = 'Order Status Update';
   const orderStatusHtml = '<p>Your order status has been updated to "Shipped".</p>'; // Replace with actual order-related content

   sendEmailNotification(recipientEmail, subject, orderStatusHtml);
   ```

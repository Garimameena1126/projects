## Creating an Array or Data Structure for Fitness Tips

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of creating an array or data structure to store a collection of fitness tips or exercise suggestions. We will also implement a function to randomly select a tip from the collection and display it on the website's content section. Let's get started!

### Step 1: Define the Fitness Tips Collection

1. Open the `script.js` file in a text editor.

   ```bash
   code script.js
   ```

2. Declare a variable named `fitnessTips` and assign it an empty array. This array will store the collection of fitness tips.

   ```javascript
   // script.js

   let fitnessTips = [];
   ```

### Step 2: Add Fitness Tips to the Collection

1. Add fitness tips to the `fitnessTips` array by pushing them using the `push()` method.

   ```javascript
   // script.js

   fitnessTips.push("Take a 30-minute walk every day.");
   fitnessTips.push("Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily.");
   fitnessTips.push("Include strength training exercises in your workout routine.");
   // Add more fitness tips as needed
   ```

2. You can add as many fitness tips as you want by repeating the `push()` method with different tip values.

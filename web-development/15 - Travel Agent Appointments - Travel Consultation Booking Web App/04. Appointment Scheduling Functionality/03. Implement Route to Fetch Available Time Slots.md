1. **Set up the route**: In your Node.js application, you'll need to set up a route to handle the request for fetching available time slots. This route will be responsible for querying the database and returning the relevant data. Here's an example of how you can set up the route using Express.js:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();

   // Define the route for fetching available time slots
   router.get('/time-slots', (req, res) => {
     // Implement the logic to fetch time slots from the database
   });

   module.exports = router;
   ```

   In the code above, we import the `express` library and create a new router instance using `express.Router()`. We define a `GET` route at the path `/time-slots`. The callback function `(req, res)` will be executed when a request is made to this route.

2. **Implement the logic to fetch time slots**: Inside the route callback function, you'll need to implement the logic to fetch available time slots from the database. Assuming you have a MongoDB connection and a schema for appointments, you can use Mongoose to query the database. Here's an example of how you can fetch the time slots:

   ```javascript
   const Appointment = require('../models/appointment'); // Assuming you have a model for appointments

   router.get('/time-slots', (req, res) => {
     Appointment.find()
       .then(appointments => {
         const timeSlots = appointments.map(appointment => appointment.timeSlot);
         res.json(timeSlots);
       })
       .catch(error => {
         console.error('Error fetching time slots:', error);
         res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to fetch time slots' });
       });
   });
   ```

   In the code above, we import the `Appointment` model (assuming you have defined it) and use the `find` method to retrieve all appointments from the database. We then extract the `timeSlot` field from each appointment and store them in an array named `timeSlots`. Finally, we send the `timeSlots` array as a JSON response using `res.json(timeSlots)`.

3. **Test the route**: You can now test the route by starting your Node.js server and making a GET request to the `/time-slots` endpoint. You should receive a JSON response containing the available time slots retrieved from the database.

In this guide, we will modify the cart logic to check if the items in the cart are eligible for the applied coupon.

## Step 1: Retrieve Applied Coupon

1. Identify the mechanism through which the applied coupon is stored or associated with the cart.
2. Retrieve the applied coupon from the cart or the session, depending on your project's implementation.

    Example (Python/Django):
    
    ```python
    # Assuming the applied coupon is stored in the session
    applied_coupon = request.session.get('applied_coupon')
    ```

## Step 2: Retrieve Eligible Products or Categories

1. Access the coupon model to retrieve the eligible products or categories associated with the applied coupon.
2. Store the eligible products or categories in a suitable data structure for easier comparison with the items in the cart.
    
    Example (Python/Django):
    
    ```python
    eligible_products = applied_coupon.products.all()
    eligible_categories = applied_coupon.categories.all()
    ```

## Step 3: Check Item Eligibility in Cart

1. Iterate over the items in the cart.
2. For each item, check if the item's product or category is included in the list of eligible products or categories obtained in the previous step.
3. Apply the coupon to eligible items or adjust the cart total accordingly.
    
    Example (Python/Django):
    
    ```python
    def apply_coupon_to_cart(cart, applied_coupon):
        for item in cart.items:
            if item.product in eligible_products or item.product.category in eligible_categories:
                # Apply the coupon to the item or adjust the cart total accordingly
                item.apply_coupon(applied_coupon)
    
        # Update the cart totals and other relevant information
        cart.update_totals()
    ```

#Implement API Calls to Retrieve Exercise Suggestions Based on User Input

In this task, we will implement API calls to retrieve exercise suggestions based on user input. This will allow us to fetch exercise data from the chosen fitness API and display relevant exercise options for the user to choose from. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Set Up API Credentials

Before making API calls, ensure that you have obtained the necessary credentials from the fitness API provider. This typically involves obtaining an API key or token. Follow the provider's documentation to register an account, create a project, and generate the required credentials.

## Step 2: Prepare the Exercise Search Form

Create a form in your user interface (UI) that allows the user to enter their exercise search query. This form could include an input field and a search button. Make sure to capture the user's input when they submit the form.

```html
<!-- HTML exercise search form -->
<form id="exercise-search-form">
  <input type="text" id="exercise-input" placeholder="Enter exercise keyword">
  <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>
```

## Step 3: Handle Form Submission

Using JavaScript, add an event listener to the form's submit event. When the user submits the form, prevent the default form submission behavior and retrieve the exercise search query from the input field.

```javascript
// JavaScript form submission handling
const form = document.getElementById('exercise-search-form');

form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default form submission

  const exerciseQuery = document.getElementById('exercise-input').value;
  
  // Perform API call using the exercise query
  fetchExercises(exerciseQuery);
});
```

## Step 4: Perform the API Call

Inside the form submission event handler, define a function called `fetchExercises` that performs the API call to retrieve exercise suggestions based on the user's input.

```javascript
function fetchExercises(query) {
  const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
  const apiUrl = `https://api.example.com/exercises?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}&api_key=${apiKey}`;

  fetch(apiUrl)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      // Process the retrieved exercise data
      displayExerciseSuggestions(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // Handle any errors
      console.error(error);
    });
}
```

In the `fetchExercises` function, replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with the actual API key you obtained from the fitness API provider. Adjust the `apiUrl` to match the API's endpoint and query parameters based on the API documentation.

## Step 5: Process and Display Exercise Suggestions

Create a function called `displayExerciseSuggestions` that takes the retrieved exercise data as input. Inside this function, you can manipulate the UI to display the exercise suggestions to the user.

```javascript
function displayExerciseSuggestions(exercises) {
  const suggestionsContainer = document.getElementById('exercise-suggestions');

  // Clear any existing suggestions
  suggestionsContainer.innerHTML = '';

  if (exercises.length === 0) {
    suggestionsContainer.textContent = 'No exercises found.';
  } else {
    exercises.forEach(exercise => {
      const exerciseItem = document.createElement('div');
      exerciseItem.textContent = exercise.name;
      suggestionsContainer.appendChild(exerciseItem);
    });
  }
}
```

In the `displayExerciseSuggestions` function, `exercises` represents the array of exercise objects returned from the API call. Adjust the code inside the `forEach` loop to match the structure of the exercise data provided by the fitness API.

## Step 6: Update the UI

In your UI, create a container element (e.g., `<div id="exercise-suggestions"></div>`) where the exercise suggestions will be displayed. This element will be manipulated by the `displayExerciseSuggestions` function to show the suggestions.

```html
<!-- HTML exercise suggestions container -->
<div id="exercise-suggestions"></div>
```

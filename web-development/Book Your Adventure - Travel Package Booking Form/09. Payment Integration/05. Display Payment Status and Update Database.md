
## 9.5: Display Payment Success/Failure Messages and Update the Database

In this task, we will focus on displaying payment success/failure messages to the user and updating the database based on the payment status. Follow the steps below to accomplish this.

1. Identify the Payment Status
   - Retrieve the payment status from the response received from the payment gateway after processing the payment.
   - The payment gateway's API or SDK should provide a response containing the payment status (e.g., "success" or "failure").

2. Display the Payment Message
   - Determine where you want to display the payment message to the user (e.g., on a web page or in a mobile app).
   - Use conditional statements or dynamic rendering to display different messages based on the payment status.
   - For example, if the payment status is "success," display a success message such as "Payment Successful! Thank you for your purchase." If the status is "failure," display an error message like "Payment Failed. Please try again."

3. Update the Database
   - Access the database where you store the relevant payment information.
   - Identify the table or collection that holds the payment details.
   - Update the corresponding record in the database based on the payment status.
   - If the payment is successful, mark the payment record as completed or update relevant fields (e.g., set a flag indicating payment success).
   - If the payment fails, update the record to reflect the failure status and possibly store any relevant error messages.

4. Test and Validate
   - Simulate successful and failed payments to verify the behavior of the system.
   - Ensure that the appropriate payment message is displayed to the user based on the payment status.
   - Confirm that the database is updated correctly with the payment status and any associated information.

Example Code Snippets:

JavaScript (Client-Side):
```javascript
// Assuming you have retrieved the payment status from the server response
const paymentStatus = "success"; // or "failure"

// Display payment message to the user
if (paymentStatus === "success") {
  displaySuccessMessage("Payment Successful! Thank you for your purchase.");
} else if (paymentStatus === "failure") {
  displayErrorMessage("Payment Failed. Please try again.");
}

// Function to display success message
function displaySuccessMessage(message) {
  // Code to display the success message to the user
}

// Function to display error message
function displayErrorMessage(message) {
  // Code to display the error message to the user
}
```

Backend (Server-Side):
```python
# Assuming you have retrieved the payment status from the payment gateway's response
payment_status = "success"  # or "failure"

# Update the database based on the payment status
if payment_status == "success":
    update_payment_record(payment_id, status="completed")
else:
    update_payment_record(payment_id, status="failed", error_message="Payment failed.")

# Function to update payment record in the database
def update_payment_record(payment_id, status, error_message=None):
    # Code to update the payment record in the database
}
```

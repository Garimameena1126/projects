# Task: Implement User Profiles to Track Individual Workout History

In this task, we will enhance the project by implementing user profiles. User profiles will allow users to track their individual workout history and progress. Each user will have their own profile that stores their exercise logs and relevant information.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step guide to implement this functionality.

## Step 1: Set Up User Profile Database

1. Create a new table or collection in your database to store user profiles. The structure of the user profile will depend on your project's requirements. At a minimum, it should include fields such as `userId`, `name`, `email`, and any additional information you want to track.

2. Define the appropriate relationships between the user profile and exercise log tables or collections. This will enable you to associate exercise logs with the corresponding user profile.

## Step 2: Create User Profile Components

1. Create a new component for displaying and editing user profiles. This component will allow users to view and modify their profile information.

2. Use appropriate form inputs and UI elements to collect the necessary information, such as name, email, profile picture, etc.

   ```javascript
   // Example code snippet for a user profile form component
   import React, { useState } from 'react';

   function UserProfileForm({ profile }) {
     const [name, setName] = useState(profile.name);
     const [email, setEmail] = useState(profile.email);

     const handleSubmit = (event) => {
       event.preventDefault();
       // Submit the updated profile data to the server
       // Update the profile information in the database
     };

     return (
       <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
         <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
         <input
           type="text"
           id="name"
           value={name}
           onChange={(event) => setName(event.target.value)}
         />

         <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
         <input
           type="email"
           id="email"
           value={email}
           onChange={(event) => setEmail(event.target.value)}
         />

         <button type="submit">Save</button>
       </form>
     );
   }
   ```

   Customize the form fields and submit logic based on your project's requirements.

## Step 3: Display User Profile Information

1. Create a component for displaying the user profile information. This component will fetch the user profile data from the backend and render it on the screen.

   ```javascript
   // Example code snippet for a user profile display component
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

   function UserProfile({ userId }) {
     const [profile, setProfile] = useState(null);

     useEffect(() => {
       // Fetch the user profile data based on the userId
       // Update the profile state variable with the fetched data
     }, [userId]);

     if (!profile) {
       return <div>Loading...</div>;
     }

     return (
       <div>
         <h2>User Profile</h2>
         <p>Name: {profile.name}</p>
         <p>Email: {profile.email}</p>
         {/* Display other profile information */}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   Customize the profile display and add any additional fields you want to show.

## Step 4: Connect User Profile to Exercise Logs

1. Modify the existing exercise log functionality to associate each exercise log entry with the user's profile.

   ```javascript
   // Example code snippet for adding exercise log to user profile
   function addExerciseLog(userId, exerciseData) {
     // Add the exercise log to the user's profile in the database
     // Make sure to associate the log entry with the correct user based on the userId
   }
   ``

`

   Update your code to ensure that exercise logs are stored in the appropriate user profile.

2. Retrieve exercise logs specific to a user's profile when displaying the exercise history.

   ```javascript
   // Example code snippet for retrieving exercise logs for a user profile
   function getExerciseLogs(userId) {
     // Retrieve the exercise logs from the user's profile in the database
     // Return the logs associated with the specified userId
   }
   ```

   Adapt your code to retrieve exercise logs based on the user's profile.

## Step 5: Update User Profile in UI

1. Integrate the user profile components into your application's UI. This may involve creating new pages or updating existing ones.

2. Add navigation and user interface elements to allow users to access and edit their profiles.

3. Update the exercise log display to show the user's profile information alongside the exercise history.

## Step 6: Test and Refine

1. Test the user profile functionality thoroughly, making sure that user profiles are correctly associated with exercise logs and that profile information is displayed and saved accurately.

2. Iterate and refine the user profile feature based on user feedback and any additional requirements.

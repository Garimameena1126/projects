# Allowing Users to Update Dietary Preferences and Goals

In this task, you will enhance the functionality of your meal planner application by allowing users to update their dietary preferences and goals within their accounts. This feature provides a personalized experience for users to customize their meal plans based on their specific dietary needs and objectives. Follow this step-by-step guide to implement the ability for users to update their dietary preferences and goals.

## Step 1: Define the Dietary Preferences and Goals

1. Determine the specific dietary preferences and goals you want to incorporate into your application. Examples include vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, low-carb, high-protein, weight loss, muscle gain, etc.

2. Create a list of dietary preference and goal options that users can choose from. This can be implemented as checkboxes, dropdown menus, or a combination of both.

## Step 2: Update the User Account Model

1. Modify the user account model or schema to include fields for storing the selected dietary preferences and goals. These fields can be stored as arrays, strings, or any other appropriate data type based on your database schema.

2. If using a database migration system, generate and run a migration to add the new fields to the user account table.

## Step 3: Update the User Account Update Form

1. Update the user account update form to include the dietary preference and goal options.

2. Depending on your frontend framework or library, use appropriate form components such as checkboxes or dropdown menus to allow users to select their preferences and goals.

## Step 4: Handle User Account Update Requests

1. Modify the server-side code to handle user account update requests.

2. Retrieve the updated dietary preferences and goals from the request payload.

3. Validate and sanitize the user input to ensure it meets the required format and does not pose security risks.

4. Update the user's account record in the database with the new dietary preferences and goals.

## Step 5: Display User's Dietary Preferences and Goals

1. Update the user account profile page or dashboard to display the user's selected dietary preferences and goals.

2. Retrieve the dietary preference and goal data from the user's account record in the database.

3. Render the information on the user interface, ensuring it is visually clear and easily understandable.

## Step 6: Test the Update Functionality

1. Create test cases to verify the update functionality for dietary preferences and goals.

2. Test the user account update flow, ensuring that the selected preferences and goals are correctly saved and displayed.

3. Verify that users can update their dietary preferences and goals multiple times without any issues.

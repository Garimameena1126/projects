# Restrict Access to API Endpoints and Frontend Features Based on User Roles

In this guide, we will focus on restricting access to certain API endpoints and frontend features based on user roles. By implementing role-based access control, we can ensure that only authorized users with specific roles can access restricted functionalities. Let's proceed with the step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Define Roles and Permissions

Before we can start restricting access, we need to define the roles and corresponding permissions in our application. Roles represent different user types or levels of access, while permissions define the specific actions or functionalities associated with each role.

For example, let's consider two roles: `admin` and `employee`. The `admin` role might have permissions to create, read, update, and delete data, while the `employee` role may have permission only to read data.

You can define roles and permissions in your database or use a configuration file, depending on your application's architecture and requirements.

## Step 2: Identify Access Control Points

Next, we need to identify the access control points in our application. These points can be API endpoints or frontend features that require role-based restrictions. For example, API endpoints for creating or deleting data, or frontend features like an admin dashboard.

Make a list of all the access control points that need to be restricted based on user roles.

## Step 3: Implement Role-Based Middleware or Interceptors

To enforce role-based access control, we can use middleware (in the case of server-side applications) or interceptors (in the case of client-side applications).

### Server-Side (API Endpoints)

If you're working on a server-side application, you can implement role-based middleware to intercept requests and verify the user's role before allowing access to certain endpoints. Here's an example using Express.js:

```javascript
// Middleware function to check user role
const checkUserRole = (requiredRole) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    const { user } = req;
    if (user.role === requiredRole) {
      // User has the required role, proceed to the next middleware or route handler
      next();
    } else {
      // User does not have the required role, return a 403 Forbidden response
      res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied' });
    }
  };
};

// Example usage of the middleware for an admin-only endpoint
app.post('/api/users', checkUserRole('admin'), (req, res) => {
  // Logic for creating a new user
});
```

Adjust the code based on your specific server framework and user authentication mechanism.

### Client-Side (Frontend Features)

For client-side applications, you can use interceptors to check the user's role before allowing access to certain frontend features. Here's an example using Axios in a React application:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

// Axios interceptor to check user role before making a request
axios.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const userRole = getUserRole(); // Function to get the user's role
    if (config.requiredRole && userRole !== config.requiredRole) {
      // User does not have the required role, prevent the request from being sent
      throw new Error('Access denied');
    }
    return config;
  },
  (error) => {
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);

// Example usage of the interceptor for an admin-only feature
const deleteUser = async (userId) => {
  try {
    await axios.delete(`/api/users/${userId}`, { requiredRole: 'admin' });
    // Logic for handling successful deletion
  } catch (error) {
    // Logic for handling access denied or other errors
  }
};
```

Adjust the

 code based on your chosen frontend framework and HTTP client library.

## Step 4: Update Frontend Components

To provide a seamless user experience, it's essential to update the frontend components based on the user's role. This includes hiding or disabling features that the user doesn't have access to.

For example, if an employee logs in, certain buttons or options should be hidden from their view. Here's an example of updating a React component based on the user's role:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const AdminDashboard = ({ user }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>
      {user.role === 'admin' && (
        <div>
          <button>Create User</button>
          <button>Delete User</button>
        </div>
      )}
      {/* Rest of the admin dashboard */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default AdminDashboard;
```

Make sure to adjust the code based on your chosen frontend framework and user authentication mechanism.

## Step 5: Test Access Control Functionality

Testing the access control functionality is crucial to ensure that the restrictions are working as expected. Here are some test scenarios to consider:

1. Log in with different user roles and verify that the restricted endpoints/features are accessible or inaccessible based on the roles.
2. Try accessing the restricted endpoints/features without proper authorization and verify that a 403 Forbidden response or appropriate error message is received.

Perform thorough testing to validate the role-based access control in your application.

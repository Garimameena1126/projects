# Implement Server-side Routes and Controllers for CRUD Operations on Exercises

In this task, we will implement server-side routes and controllers to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on exercises in the workout tracking app. This will allow users to perform actions such as creating new exercises, retrieving existing exercises, updating exercise details, and deleting exercises. Follow the steps below to implement these functionalities.

## Step 1: Design the Exercise API

Before implementing the routes and controllers, it's essential to design the RESTful API for exercises. The API will define the endpoints and the corresponding HTTP methods for each CRUD operation. Here is a suggested API design for exercises:

| Endpoint                   | Method | Description                    |
|----------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| /exercises                 | GET    | Get all exercises              |
| /exercises                 | POST   | Create a new exercise          |
| /exercises/:exerciseId     | GET    | Get a specific exercise        |
| /exercises/:exerciseId     | PUT    | Update a specific exercise     |
| /exercises/:exerciseId     | DELETE | Delete a specific exercise     |

Based on this API design, we will now proceed with implementing the server-side routes and controllers.

## Step 2: Create a `routes` Folder

To organize our routes and controllers, let's create a `routes` folder in your project directory. This folder will contain all the route files for different resources of your application. Follow these steps to create the `routes` folder:

1. Inside your project directory, create a new folder called `routes`.

2. This folder will serve as the container for all route files.

## Step 3: Create an `exercises.js` Route File

Inside the `routes` folder, create a new file called `exercises.js`. This file will define the routes and corresponding controller functions for exercises. Follow these steps to create the `exercises.js` file:

1. Inside the `routes` folder, create a new file called `exercises.js`.

2. Open the `exercises.js` file in your preferred code editor.

## Step 4: Set Up Express Router and Import Dependencies

In the `exercises.js` file, we will set up an Express router and import the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Add the following code at the beginning of the `exercises.js` file to import the required dependencies and set up the Express router:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Import necessary controller functions
const { getExercises, createExercise, getExercise, updateExercise, deleteExercise } = require('../controllers/exerciseController');
```

In the above code, we import Express and create a router using `express.Router()`. We also import the controller functions we will create later.

## Step 5: Define Routes for CRUD Operations

In this step, we will define the routes for each CRUD operation on exercises. Follow these steps:

1. Add the following code in the `exercises.js` file to define the routes for CRUD operations:

```javascript
// Routes for CRUD operations on exercises
router.route('/')
  .get(getExercises)
  .post(createExercise);

router.route('/:exerciseId')
  .get(getExercise)
  .put(updateExercise)
  .delete(deleteExercise);
```

In the above code, we define the routes for various CRUD operations on exercises. The routes are mapped to their corresponding controller functions.

## Step 6: Create the Exercise Controller

Next, we will create the exercise controller file to handle the logic for each CRUD operation. Follow these steps to create the controller file:

1. Inside your project directory, create a new folder called `controllers`.

2. Inside the `

controllers` folder, create a new file called `exerciseController.js`.

3. Open the `exerciseController.js` file in your code editor.

## Step 7: Define Controller Functions

In the `exerciseController.js` file, we will define the controller functions to handle the logic for CRUD operations on exercises. Follow these steps:

1. Add the following code to the `exerciseController.js` file to define the controller functions:

```javascript
// Controller functions for CRUD operations on exercises
const getExercises = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve all exercises
};

const createExercise = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to create a new exercise
};

const getExercise = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve a specific exercise
};

const updateExercise = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to update a specific exercise
};

const deleteExercise = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to delete a specific exercise
};
```

In the above code, we have defined the controller functions for each CRUD operation. These functions will contain the actual logic to handle the respective operations.

## Step 8: Implement the Controller Logic

Now, we will implement the logic for each controller function. Depending on your specific requirements, you will need to interact with your database or any other data source to perform the CRUD operations. Here's an example of how you can implement the logic:

```javascript
// Controller functions for CRUD operations on exercises
const getExercises = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve all exercises from the database
  Exercise.find({}, (err, exercises) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while retrieving exercises.' });
    } else {
      res.status(200).json(exercises);
    }
  });
};

const createExercise = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to create a new exercise
  const { name, description, duration } = req.body;
  const newExercise = new Exercise({ name, description, duration });

  newExercise.save((err, exercise) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while creating the exercise.' });
    } else {
      res.status(201).json(exercise);
    }
  });
};

const getExercise = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve a specific exercise
  const { exerciseId } = req.params;

  Exercise.findById(exerciseId, (err, exercise) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while retrieving the exercise.' });
    } else if (!exercise) {
      res.status(404).json({ error: 'Exercise not found.' });
    } else {
      res.status(200).json(exercise);
    }
  });
};

const updateExercise = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to update a specific exercise
  const { exerciseId } = req.params;
  const { name, description, duration } = req.body;

  Exercise.findByIdAndUpdate(
    exerciseId,
    { name, description, duration },
    { new: true },
    (err, updatedExercise) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while updating the exercise.' });
      } else if (!updatedExercise) {
        res.status(404).json({ error: 'Exercise not found.' });
      } else {
        res.status(200).json(updatedExercise);
      }
    }
  );
};

const delete

Exercise = (req, res) => {
  // Logic to delete a specific exercise
  const { exerciseId } = req.params;

  Exercise.findByIdAndDelete(exerciseId, (err, deletedExercise) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while deleting the exercise.' });
    } else if (!deletedExercise) {
      res.status(404).json({ error: 'Exercise not found.' });
    } else {
      res.status(200).json(deletedExercise);
    }
  });
};
```

In the above code, we assume the use of a `Exercise` model and database for storing exercises. Modify the logic according to your specific database and model implementation.

## Step 9: Export the Controller Functions

Lastly, we need to export the controller functions from the `exerciseController.js` file so that they can be used in the routes file. Add the following code at the end of the `exerciseController.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  getExercises,
  createExercise,
  getExercise,
  updateExercise,
  deleteExercise
};
```

## Step 10: Import the Exercise Routes

Finally, we need to import the exercise routes in the main server file. Follow these steps:

1. Open the main server file (e.g., `app.js`, `server.js`) in your code editor.

2. Add the following code at the top of the server file to import the exercise routes:

```javascript
const exerciseRoutes = require('./routes/exercises');
```

3. Then, add the following code after setting up your middleware to use the exercise routes:

```javascript
// Use exercise routes
app.use('/exercises', exerciseRoutes);
```

In the above code, we assume that your main server file is using `app` as the Express application instance. Adjust the code according to your actual setup.

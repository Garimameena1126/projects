# Beginner's Guide: Defining API Endpoints for Travel Agency Data

In this guide, we will focus on defining API endpoints for retrieving destinations, packages, and testimonials in a RESTful API. These endpoints will allow external applications to access the relevant data from the travel agency's database. Let's follow the step-by-step process to define the endpoints.

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

Make sure you have completed the initial setup for your API project as described in the module's introduction.

## Step 2: Define the API Endpoints

1. Open the `server.js` file in your project's directory.

2. Import any necessary modules and setup middleware if required.

3. Define the API endpoints for retrieving destinations, packages, and testimonials. Each endpoint should have a unique URL path and an associated HTTP method.

### Endpoint 1: Retrieve Destinations

Define an endpoint to retrieve a list of destinations from the travel agency's database. Use the HTTP GET method for this endpoint.

Example:
```javascript
app.get('/destinations', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve destinations from the database
  // Send the retrieved destinations as the API response
});
```

### Endpoint 2: Retrieve Packages

Define an endpoint to retrieve a list of packages from the travel agency's database. Use the HTTP GET method for this endpoint.

Example:
```javascript
app.get('/packages', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve packages from the database
  // Send the retrieved packages as the API response
});
```

### Endpoint 3: Retrieve Testimonials

Define an endpoint to retrieve a list of testimonials from the travel agency's database. Use the HTTP GET method for this endpoint.

Example:
```javascript
app.get('/testimonials', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve testimonials from the database
  // Send the retrieved testimonials as the API response
});
```

## Step 3: Implement Request Handling Logic

1. Inside each endpoint's route handler, write the necessary logic to retrieve the data from the database or any other data source.

2. Format the retrieved data in a suitable format, such as JSON, and send it as the API response.

Example for the "Retrieve Destinations" endpoint:
```javascript
app.get('/destinations', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to retrieve destinations from the database
  const destinations = [
    { name: 'Destination 1', location: 'Location 1' },
    { name: 'Destination 2', location: 'Location 2' },
    // Add more destinations as needed
  ];

  // Send the retrieved destinations as the API response
  res.json(destinations);
});
```

Repeat this logic for the "Retrieve Packages" and "Retrieve Testimonials" endpoints, replacing the data source and response format as necessary.

## Step 4: Test the API Endpoints

1. Save the changes to `server.js`.

2. Start the API server by running the following command in the project's directory:
```shell
node server.js
```

3. Use a tool like Postman or a web browser to send GET requests to the defined endpoints (`/destinations`, `/packages`, `/testimonials`).

4. Verify that the responses contain the expected data.

1. **Identify the trigger event**: Determine the event or action that signifies a new appointment has been scheduled. This could be a form submission, an API call, or any other event specific to your project.

2. **Implement the trigger event**: Implement the code logic to handle the trigger event. This will vary depending on your project setup and the technologies you are using. For the purpose of this guide, let's assume you have a function called `scheduleAppointment` that handles the creation of new appointments. Modify this function to include the call to the email notification function after a new appointment is successfully scheduled.

   ```javascript
   function scheduleAppointment(appointmentData) {
     // Code to create and save the new appointment

     // Call the email notification function after the appointment is scheduled
     sendAppointmentNotification(appointmentData);
   }
   ```

   In this example, we assume that the `appointmentData` object contains all the necessary information about the newly scheduled appointment.

3. **Test the trigger**: Trigger the event by simulating the creation of a new appointment. This can be done by manually calling the `scheduleAppointment` function with sample appointment data.

   ```javascript
   const newAppointment = {
     // Define the appointment details
   };

   scheduleAppointment(newAppointment);
   ```

   Replace the `newAppointment` object with the actual appointment data. This code snippet demonstrates how you can manually trigger the `scheduleAppointment` function and, consequently, the email notification function.

4. **Verify the email notification**: After triggering the event, check the recipient's email inbox to ensure that the email notification was sent successfully. You should receive an email with the appointment details if everything is set up correctly.

   Note: Make sure you have configured Nodemailer with a valid email account (as described in the previous tasks) to ensure the email is sent successfully.

# Beginner's Guide to Implementing User Authentication and Authorization

In this guide, we will walk through the process of implementing user authentication and authorization to secure our web application. User authentication ensures that only registered users can access certain parts of the application, while user authorization determines the level of access each user has within the application. We will use the Flask framework for this task.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Flask (version 2.0.1 or higher)

You can install Flask using pip:

```shell
pip install flask
```

## Step 1: Set Up Flask Application

First, let's set up a basic Flask application. Create a new Python file called `app.py` and import the necessary modules:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set up routes and views
# ...
```

## Step 2: Create User Model

Next, we need to define a user model to store user information. Create a new Python file called `models.py` and add the following code:

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    # Add more fields as needed

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<User {self.username}>'
```

Make sure you have a database set up and configured in your Flask application. You can refer to the Flask SQLAlchemy documentation for more information on how to set up a database connection.

## Step 3: Create User Registration

Now, let's implement the user registration functionality. Add the following code to your `app.py` file:

```python
from models import db, User

# Configure database connection
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'your_database_connection_uri'
db.init_app(app)

@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        # Additional validation and error handling
        user = User(username=username, password=password)
        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()
        return redirect('/')
    return render_template('register.html')
```

In this code, we define a route `/register` that handles both GET and POST requests. For GET requests, we render a registration form using the `register.html` template. For POST requests, we retrieve the username and password from the form, create a new `User` object, and add it to the database.

## Step 4: Create User Login

Next, let's implement the user login functionality. Add the following code to your `app.py` file:

```python
from flask_login import LoginManager, login_user, logout_user, login_required

login_manager = LoginManager()
login_manager.login_view = 'login'
login_manager.init_app(app)

@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User.query.get(int(user_id))

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
        if user and user.password == password:
            login_user(user)
            return redirect('/dashboard')
        else:
            error = 'Invalid username or password'
            return render_template('login.html', error=error)
    return render_template('login.html')

@app

.route('/logout')
@login_required
def logout():
    logout_user()
    return redirect('/')
```

In this code, we configure the Flask-Login extension to handle user login functionality. We define a login manager and set the login view to `/login`. We also define a user loader function that retrieves the user object based on the user ID stored in the session.

The `/login` route handles both GET and POST requests. For GET requests, we render a login form using the `login.html` template. For POST requests, we retrieve the username and password from the form, validate the credentials, and log the user in using the `login_user` function.

The `/logout` route logs the user out by calling the `logout_user` function and redirects them to the homepage.

## Step 5: Protect Routes with Authorization

To protect certain routes and ensure that only authenticated users can access them, we can use the `@login_required` decorator provided by Flask-Login. For example:

```python
@app.route('/dashboard')
@login_required
def dashboard():
    # Route logic for the dashboard
    return render_template('dashboard.html')
```

In this code, the `/dashboard` route is protected with the `@login_required` decorator, which ensures that only logged-in users can access the dashboard page.

## Step 6: Create Templates

Finally, let's create the HTML templates for the registration, login, and dashboard pages. Create a new folder called `templates` and add the following files:

- `register.html`: HTML form for user registration.
- `login.html`: HTML form for user login.
- `dashboard.html`: HTML template for the dashboard page.

You can customize these templates to match your application's design and requirements.

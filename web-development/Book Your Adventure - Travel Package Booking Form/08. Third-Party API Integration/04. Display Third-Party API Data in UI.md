In this task, we will update the user interface (UI) of our project to display the data fetched from the third-party API. Follow the steps below to accomplish this.

1. Identify the UI Components
   - Determine which UI components need to be updated to display the fetched data.
   - For example, if you are fetching flight availability, you might want to update a table or a list component to show the flight details.

2. Define Data Storage
   - Create a suitable data structure to store the fetched data in your application.
   - This could be an array, an object, or any other appropriate data structure based on your project's needs.
   - The structure should be designed to easily map the fetched data to the UI components.

3. Update the API Integration Logic
   - Ensure that you have completed Task 8.3, where you designed and implemented API integration endpoints to fetch the real-time travel package data.
   - Make sure the API request function is successfully fetching the data from the API provider.
   - Update the API integration logic to store the fetched data in the data storage structure you defined.

4. Bind Data to UI Components
   - Determine the appropriate places in your UI components where the fetched data should be displayed.
   - Use data binding techniques provided by your chosen UI framework or library to bind the fetched data to the respective UI elements.
   - This might involve updating the component state, passing props, or using other data-binding mechanisms.

5. Render the Fetched Data
   - In the relevant UI components, render the fetched data using appropriate HTML or UI syntax.
   - Map through the data structure and dynamically generate the necessary UI elements to display the fetched information.
   - Utilize loops, conditionals, and templating to format and present the data in a user-friendly manner.

   Example (React with JSX):
   ```jsx
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   import { fetchTravelPackages } from './api'; // Assuming you have implemented the API request function
   
   function TravelPackagesList() {
     const [travelPackages, setTravelPackages] = useState([]);
   
     useEffect(() => {
       async function fetchData() {
         try {
           const data = await fetchTravelPackages();
           setTravelPackages(data);
         } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error fetching travel packages:', error);
         }
       }
   
       fetchData();
     }, []);
   
     return (
       <div>
         <h2>Travel Packages</h2>
         <ul>
           {travelPackages.map((package) => (
             <li key={package.id}>
               <h3>{package.name}</h3>
               <p>{package.description}</p>
               <p>Price: {package.price}</p>
             </li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

6. Style the UI
   - Apply appropriate CSS styles or UI framework classes to format and enhance the appearance of the fetched data.
   - Use CSS selectors or class names to target the relevant UI components and apply the desired styles.
   - Experiment with layout, typography, colors, and other visual aspects to create an appealing UI.

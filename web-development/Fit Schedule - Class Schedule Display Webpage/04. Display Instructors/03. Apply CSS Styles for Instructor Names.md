1. Open the HTML file (index.html) and locate the section where the class names, timings, and instructors are being dynamically generated.
2. Identify the HTML elements that contain the instructor names. For example, let's assume they are `<p>` elements with a specific class assigned to them.
3. Open the CSS file associated with your project (if you don't have one, create a new file named "styles.css" in the same directory as your HTML file).
4. Link the CSS file to your HTML file by adding the following code inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file:
    
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    ```

Explanation:
- The `<link>` element is used to link an external CSS file to an HTML file.
- The `rel="stylesheet"` attribute specifies that the linked file is a stylesheet.
- The `href` attribute specifies the path to the CSS file. Make sure to adjust the `href` value based on the location of your CSS file.

5. In the CSS file, start by targeting the instructor elements using the class selector. For example:

    ```css
    .instructor {
      /* CSS styles for instructor names go here */
    }
    ```

Explanation:
- `.instructor` is a class selector that targets all elements with the assigned class name "instructor".

6. Apply appropriate CSS styles to differentiate the instructor names. You can use various CSS properties to achieve the desired visual effects. For example:

    ```css
    .instructor {
      font-weight: bold;
      color: blue;
    }
    ```

Explanation:
- `font-weight: bold;` sets the text to appear in bold.
- `color: blue;` changes the text color to blue.

7. Save the CSS file.

Now, when you refresh your webpage, you should see the instructor names differentiated from the class names and timings based on the applied CSS styles.

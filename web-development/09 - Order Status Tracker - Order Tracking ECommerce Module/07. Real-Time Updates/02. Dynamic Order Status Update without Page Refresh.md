To update the order status dynamically without requiring a page refresh, follow the step-by-step guide below:

## Step 1: Set Up WebSocket Communication

1. Make sure you have already implemented WebSocket functionality using a suitable WebSocket library as mentioned in the previous guide.

2. Ensure that your WebSocket server is running and listening for incoming connections.

## Step 2: Connect to WebSocket Server from the Frontend

1. In your frontend code, establish a WebSocket connection with the server.

   - Example code using JavaScript:

     ```javascript
     // Establish a WebSocket connection
     const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000');

     // Handle the connection open event
     socket.onopen = () => {
       console.log('WebSocket connection established');
     };

     // Handle the incoming message event
     socket.onmessage = (event) => {
       const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

       // Handle the received order status update
       // Example: Update the order status element with the updated data
     };

     // Handle the connection close event
     socket.onclose = () => {
       console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
     };
     ```

2. Customize the code to handle the received order status update and update the order status element in your frontend UI accordingly.

## Step 3: Send Order Status Updates from the Backend

1. In your backend code, when there is an update to the order status, send the updated data to the connected WebSocket clients.

   - Example code using Node.js and Socket.IO:

     ```javascript
     // Assuming you have access to the WebSocket server instance (e.g., 'io') and the updated order status
     io.emit('orderStatusUpdate', { orderId: '123', status: 'completed' });
     ```

2. Make sure to emit the `orderStatusUpdate` event with the updated order status data to all connected clients.

## Step 4: Receive and Process Order Status Updates in the Frontend

1. Modify the frontend code to listen for the `orderStatusUpdate` event from the WebSocket server and update the order status element in the UI accordingly.

   - Example code using JavaScript:

     ```javascript
     // Inside the WebSocket connection handling code
     socket.onmessage = (event) => {
       const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

       if (data.event === 'orderStatusUpdate') {
         // Handle the received order status update
         // Example: Update the order status element with the updated data
       }
     };
     ```

2. Customize the code to handle the received order status update event and update the order status element in your frontend UI.

## Step 5: Test the Real-Time Order Status Updates

1. Start your backend server and ensure that the WebSocket server is running.

2. Open your frontend application in multiple browser tabs or windows.

3. Perform actions that trigger order status updates in the backend.

4. Observe that the order status is updated dynamically in all connected frontend instances without requiring a page refresh.


## Setting Up the Development Environment with Visual Studio Code

In this guide, we will walk through the process of setting up the development environment for the project using Visual Studio Code as the code editor.

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

1. Download Visual Studio Code from the official website: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Launch Visual Studio Code once the installation is complete.

### Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code Extensions

Visual Studio Code provides a wide range of extensions that enhance its functionality and make web development easier. Install the following extensions:

1. **HTML**: Syntax highlighting and snippets for HTML files.
2. **CSS**: Syntax highlighting and snippets for CSS files.
3. **JavaScript**: Syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and debugging for JavaScript files.
4. **Bootstrap 4**: IntelliSense and snippets for Bootstrap 4.
5. **Node.js**: IntelliSense, debugging, and npm support for Node.js development.
6. **Prettier**: Code formatter for consistent code styling.

To install extensions:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (`Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS) to open the Extensions view.
3. Search for the extension name in the search bar and click on the "Install" button next to the appropriate extension.

### Step 3: Create a New Project Folder

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on "File" in the menu bar and select "Open Folder" (or use the `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O` shortcut).
3. Choose a location on your computer where you want to create the project folder.
4. Give the folder a descriptive name, such as "project-management-app."
5. Click on the "Select Folder" button to open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

### Step 4: Initialize a New Git Repository and Make an Initial Commit

1. Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code by clicking on "View" in the menu bar and selecting "Terminal" â†’ "New Terminal" (or use the `Ctrl+` backtick ` shortcut).
2. Navigate to the project folder in the terminal by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/project-management-app
   ```

   Replace `path/to/project-management-app` with the actual path to your project folder.

3. Initialize a new Git repository by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. Create an initial commit by adding all the files in the project folder and making a commit:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

### Step 5: Set Up a Basic Folder Structure for the Project

To organize the project files, create a basic folder structure that separates frontend and backend code:

1. In the project folder, create two subfolders: "frontend" and "backend."

   ```bash
   mkdir frontend backend
   ```

2. The "frontend" folder will contain all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the client-side code, while the "backend" folder will store server-side code and API endpoints.

### Step 6: Initialize a package.json File for Managing Dependencies

1. In the project folder, open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the "backend" folder by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/project-management-app/backend
   ```

   Replace `path/to/project-management-app` with the actual path to your

 project folder.

3. Initialize a new `package.json` file by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

   This command will create a `package.json` file with default settings.

#  Retrieve and Display User-Specific Exercise Data from the Database

In this task, we will focus on retrieving and displaying user-specific exercise data from the database. This will allow us to show the logged exercises of each user on their profile page. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Set Up Database

Ensure that you have set up a database for your project and configured the necessary connections. You will need a table to store the exercise data, linked to the user's profile.

## Step 2: Design the Exercise Data Table

Design the exercise data table schema in your database. This table will store information such as the exercise name, date, duration, and any other relevant data for each logged exercise. Make sure to include a foreign key column that references the user's profile or user ID.

Here's an example of a basic exercise data table schema:

| Column      | Type        | Description              |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| id          | Integer     | Exercise ID (Primary Key) |
| userId      | Integer     | User ID (Foreign Key)     |
| exercise    | Varchar     | Exercise name             |
| date        | Date        | Exercise date             |
| duration    | Integer     | Exercise duration (in min)|
| ...         | ...         | ...                      |

## Step 3: Retrieve User-Specific Exercise Data

Implement a database query or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) function to retrieve the exercise data specific to the logged-in user. This query should fetch all the exercises logged by the user, typically based on their user ID.

```javascript
// Example using an ORM (e.g., Sequelize) to retrieve user-specific exercise data
const Exercise = require('../models/exercise');

function getUserExercises(userId) {
  return Exercise.findAll({
    where: {
      userId: userId
    }
  });
}
```

In this example, we use an ORM (such as Sequelize) to define an `Exercise` model and retrieve all exercises using the `findAll` method. The query includes a condition to filter the exercises based on the `userId` column.

## Step 4: Pass Exercise Data to the User Profile Page

Pass the retrieved exercise data to the user profile page template or view. This will allow you to display the exercise information for the logged-in user.

```javascript
// Example using Express.js to render the user profile page with exercise data
app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.user.id;
  const exercises = getUserExercises(userId);

  res.render('profile', { exercises });
});
```

In this example, we retrieve the user ID from the logged-in user's session (`req.user.id`) and pass it to the `getUserExercises` function to fetch the exercise data specific to that user. We then render the `profile` view, passing the `exercises` data as a parameter.

## Step 5: Display User-Specific Exercise Data

Update the user profile page template or view to display the retrieved exercise data. Iterate over the exercise data and render it in a user-friendly format.

```html
<!-- Example template for displaying user-specific exercise data -->
<h1>User Profile</h1>

<h2>Logged Exercises</h2>
<ul>
  {% for exercise in exercises %}
    <li>
      <p>Exercise: {{ exercise.name }}</p>
      <p>Date: {{ exercise.date }}</p>
      <p>Duration: {{ exercise.duration }} minutes</p>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

In this example, we use a template engine (such as Handlebars or EJS) to render the exercise data. We iterate over each exercise in the `exercises` array and display the exercise name, date, and duration.

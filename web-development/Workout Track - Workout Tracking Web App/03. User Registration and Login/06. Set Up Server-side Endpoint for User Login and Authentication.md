# Module 3: Implement User Registration and Login

## Task: Set up a server-side endpoint to handle user login and authentication

In this task, we will set up a server-side endpoint that handles user login and authentication. This endpoint will be responsible for validating user credentials and providing access to protected resources. Follow the steps below to implement this functionality.

## Step 1: Create a Login Route

1. Open your project in your preferred code editor.

2. Create a new file called `server.js` or `app.js` (or any other name of your choice) in the project's root directory.

3. In this file, import the necessary dependencies. For example, if you are using Node.js with Express, you can use the following code:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   ```

4. Define a route for handling the login request. This route will accept POST requests to the `/login` endpoint. Add the following code:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
       // Handle login request
   });
   ```

## Step 2: Retrieve User Credentials

1. Inside the login route, retrieve the user credentials from the request body. The user credentials typically include an email and password. Add the following code:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
       const { email, password } = req.body;
       // Use the email and password for further processing
   });
   ```

   Make sure to parse the request body using the appropriate middleware (e.g., `express.json()`).

## Step 3: Validate User Credentials

1. Implement the logic to validate the user credentials. This may involve checking if the email exists in the database and comparing the provided password with the stored hashed password. You can use a library like `bcrypt` for password hashing and comparison.

   Here's an example of how you can validate the user credentials:

   ```javascript
   const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

   app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
       const { email, password } = req.body;

       // Check if the email exists in the database
       const user = getUserByEmail(email);

       if (!user) {
           return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });
       }

       // Compare the provided password with the hashed password
       bcrypt.compare(password, user.password, (err, result) => {
           if (err) {
               return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
           }

           if (!result) {
               return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });
           }

           // User authentication successful
           // Generate a token or set a session cookie
           const token = generateToken(user);
           res.json({ token });
       });
   });
   ```

   Replace `getUserByEmail` with your own function to retrieve user information from the database, and `generateToken` with a function to generate an authentication token.

   **Note:** Make sure to handle errors appropriately and provide meaningful responses.

## Step 4: Return Authentication Token

1. If the user credentials are valid, you can generate an authentication token and return it to the client. The client can then include this token in subsequent requests to authenticate and access protected resources.

   In the example code from the previous step, we generate a token using the `generateToken` function and send it as a JSON response:

   ```javascript
   res.json({ token });
   ```

   Modify this code to match your token generation method and response format.

## Step 5: Handle Login Errors

1. If

 the user credentials are invalid or there is an error during the login process, return an appropriate error response. In the example code, we return a JSON response with an error message and the corresponding status code:

   ```javascript
   return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });
   ```

   Modify the error handling code based on your specific requirements.

## Step 6: Test the Login Endpoint

1. Start your server by running the appropriate command. For example, if you are using Node.js with Express, you can run `node server.js` or `npm start` depending on your setup.

2. Use a tool like Postman or cURL to send a POST request to the `/login` endpoint with the user credentials (email and password) in the request body.

3. Verify that you receive the expected response based on the validity of the user credentials.

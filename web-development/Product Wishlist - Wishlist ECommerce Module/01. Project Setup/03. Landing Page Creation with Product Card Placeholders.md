1. Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Make sure you have already set up the basic project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as explained in the previous guide.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your text editor.

4. Inside the `<body>` section, locate the placeholder container element you created earlier. This is the `<div>` element with the class or ID that will hold your page content.

5. Add the necessary HTML markup to create the product cards section. This can be a `<div>` element with a class or ID to represent the product cards container. For example:

   ```html
   <div class="product-cards">
     <!-- Placeholder for product cards -->
   </div>
   ```

6. Inside the product cards container, add individual product card elements. Each card can be represented by a `<div>` element with appropriate classes or IDs. Here's an example structure for a product card:

   ```html
   <div class="product-card">
     <h3>Product Name</h3>
     <img src="path/to/product-image.jpg" alt="Product Image">
     <p>Price: $19.99</p>
     <!-- Add more details as needed -->
   </div>
   ```

   You can add multiple product cards by duplicating the product card structure. Make sure to customize the content and image source for each card.

7. Save the `index.html` file.

8. Open the `styles.css` file in your text editor.

9. Locate the placeholder styles or add a new section for styling the product cards.

10. Add CSS styles to format and position the product cards. You can use CSS selectors to target the product cards container and individual product card elements. Here's an example:

    ```css
    .product-cards {
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      justify-content: center;
      gap: 20px;
    }

    .product-card {
      width: 300px;
      padding: 20px;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
      border-radius: 5px;
      text-align: center;
    }

    .product-card h3 {
      margin-top: 0;
    }

    .product-card img {
      max-width: 100%;
    }
    ```

    Adjust the styles as needed to achieve the desired appearance for your product cards.

11. Save the `styles.css` file.

12. Open the `script.js` file in your text editor.

13. If you plan to add interactivity or functionality related to the product cards or wishlist, you can write JavaScript code in this file. For now, leave it empty or add any placeholder code.

14. Save the `script.js` file.

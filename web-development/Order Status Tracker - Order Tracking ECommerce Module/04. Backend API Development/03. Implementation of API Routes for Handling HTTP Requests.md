# Implementing API Routes for Handling HTTP Requests

In this task, we will implement API routes for handling HTTP requests in our backend API. These routes will allow clients to interact with the server by sending GET, POST, and PUT requests to perform various operations on the order data. Follow the steps below to implement the API routes.

## Step 1: Set up the Project

1. Make sure you have already set up a server using a backend framework like Node.js with Express. If not, refer to the previous guide for setting up the server.

## Step 2: Create a New File for API Routes

1. In your project directory, create a new directory called `routes`.
2. Inside the `routes` directory, create a new file called `orderRoutes.js`. This file will contain the API routes for order operations.

## Step 3: Define the API Routes

1. Open the `orderRoutes.js` file in a text editor or code editor of your choice.

2. In the `orderRoutes.js` file, import the necessary modules and create a router instance:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();
   ```

3. Define the route for retrieving order details:

   ```javascript
   // GET /api/orders/:orderId
   router.get('/:orderId', (req, res) => {
     // Retrieve the order details based on the orderId parameter
     const orderId = req.params.orderId;
     // Logic to fetch the order details from the database or any other data source
     // Replace the following example code with your actual implementation
     const order = {
       id: orderId,
       customerName: 'John Doe',
       // Other order details
     };
     // Send the order details as the response
     res.json(order);
   });
   ```

   In this example, the route `/api/orders/:orderId` is defined using the `GET` method. The `orderId` parameter in the URL represents the unique identifier of the order. You can replace the example logic with your actual implementation to retrieve the order details from the database or any other data source.

4. Define the route for creating a new order:

   ```javascript
   // POST /api/orders
   router.post('/', (req, res) => {
     // Retrieve the order details from the request body
     const { orderNumber, customerName, // Other order details } = req.body;
     // Logic to create a new order in the database or any other data source
     // Replace the following example code with your actual implementation
     const newOrder = {
       id: 'unique_id',
       orderNumber: orderNumber,
       customerName: customerName,
       // Other order details
     };
     // Send the newly created order as the response
     res.json(newOrder);
   });
   ```

   In this example, the route `/api/orders` is defined using the `POST` method. The order details are expected in the request body. You can replace the example logic with your actual implementation to create a new order in the database or any other data source.

5. Define the route for updating the order status:

   ```javascript
   // PUT /api/orders/:orderId/status
   router.put('/:orderId/status', (req, res) => {
     // Retrieve the order ID and updated status from the request body
     const orderId = req.params.orderId;
     const { status } = req.body;
     // Logic to update the order status in the database or any other data source
     // Replace the following example code with your actual implementation
     // Note: This example assumes a successful update
     const updatedOrder = {
       id: orderId,
       status: status,};
     // Send the updated order as the response
     res.json(updatedOrder);
   });
   ```

   In this example, the route `/api/orders/:orderId/status` is defined using the `PUT` method. The `orderId` parameter in the URL represents the unique identifier of the order, and the updated status is expected in the request body. You can replace the example logic with your actual implementation to update the order status in the database or any other data source.

6. Export the router instance:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = router;
   ```

## Step 4: Connect the Routes to the Server

1. Open the `server.js` file (or the file where you set up your server).

2. Import the `orderRoutes` module:

   ```javascript
   const orderRoutes = require('./routes/orderRoutes');
   ```

3. Use the `orderRoutes` in your server:

   ```javascript
   // Use the order routes
   app.use('/api/orders', orderRoutes);
   ```

   In this code, we use the `orderRoutes` with the prefix `/api/orders`. This means that the order-related API routes will be accessible under the `/api/orders` URL path.

4. Start the server:

   ```javascript
   const port = 3000;
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

## Step 5: Test the API Routes

1. Ensure that your server is running. If not, start it using the appropriate command (e.g., `node server.js`).

2. Use a tool like Postman or a web browser to send HTTP requests to the defined API endpoints:
   - To retrieve order details, send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/orders/{orderId}` (replace `{orderId}` with an actual order ID).
   - To create a new order, send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/orders` and include the order details in the request body.
   - To update the order status, send a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/orders/{orderId}/status` (replace `{orderId}` with an actual order ID) and include the updated status in the request body.

3. Verify that the API endpoints return the expected responses based on your implementation.

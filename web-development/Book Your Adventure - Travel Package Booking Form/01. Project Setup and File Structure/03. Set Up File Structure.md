
## Set up a Basic File Structure

1. Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Navigate to the project folder you created earlier. This is the folder where you will set up the basic file structure.

3. Create a new file called `index.html` in the project folder. This file will serve as the main entry point for your web application. You can create the file using the following command:

   ```shell
   touch index.html
   ```

4. Open the `index.html` file in your text editor or IDE. Add the following code to create the basic structure of an HTML document:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Travel Booking Form</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     </head>
     <body>
       <script src="script.js"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   This code sets up the HTML document structure, includes the necessary meta tags, sets the page title, and links the CSS and JavaScript files.

5. Create a new file called `styles.css` in the project folder. This file will contain the CSS styles for your web application. You can create the file using the following command:

   ```shell
   touch styles.css
   ```

6. Open the `styles.css` file in your text editor or IDE. Add your CSS styles to customize the appearance of your web application. Here's an example of some basic CSS styles you can start with:

   ```css
   /* styles.css */

   body {
     font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
   }

   h1 {
     color: #333;
   }

   /* Add more styles as per your design requirements */
   ```

   Feel free to modify and add more styles to suit your project's design.

7. Create a new file called `script.js` in the project folder. This file will contain the JavaScript code for your web application. You can create the file using the following command:

   ```shell
   touch script.js
   ```

8. Open the `script.js` file in your text editor or IDE. Add your JavaScript code to handle dynamic behavior and interactivity in your web application. Here's an example of a simple JavaScript code snippet:

   ```javascript
   // script.js

   // Example JavaScript code
   function greetUser() {
     const name = prompt('Enter your name:');
     alert(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to our travel booking form.`);
   }

   // Add more JavaScript code as per your application's requirements
   ```

   Customize the JavaScript code according to your project's needs. You can define functions, handle events, manipulate the DOM, and perform various other tasks using JavaScript.

9. After setting up the basic file structure, make sure the `index.html` file is saved. You can now open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see your web application in action. It won't have any visible content yet, but you can start building upon this structure in the upcoming modules.

   To open the `index.html` file in a web browser, right-click on the file and select "Open with" or "Open in" and choose your preferred web browser.

10. Congratulations! You have successfully set up a basic file structure for your project. The `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files are ready to be further developed

 to build your web application. You can continue adding HTML content, applying CSS styles, and implementing JavaScript functionality to bring your project to life.

# Setting Up a Node.js Server with Express

In this task, we will set up a Node.js server using the Express framework. Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications. We will install Express, create a basic server file, and start the server.

## Step 1: Install Node.js and NPM

Before setting up the Node.js server, make sure you have Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you don't have them installed, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

    To verify if Node.js and NPM are installed correctly, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:
    
    ```shell
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```

    You should see the version numbers for Node.js and NPM printed in the terminal if they are installed successfully.

## Step 2: Create a Project Directory

Next, create a new project directory where we will set up our Node.js server. Open your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder for your project, for example, `project-management-app`.
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.

## Step 3: Initialize a Node.js Project

To manage dependencies and package information for our project, we need to initialize a Node.js project. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder and run the following command:

```shell
npm init -y
```

This command initializes a new Node.js project with default settings and creates a `package.json` file in your project directory.

## Step 4: Install Express

Now, we will install the Express framework as a dependency for our project. In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command:

```shell
npm install express
```

This command installs Express and its dependencies in the `node_modules` folder within your project directory.

## Step 5: Create the Server File

In this step, we will create a basic server file that sets up an Express server and listens for incoming HTTP requests. 

1. Create a new file in your project directory called `server.js`.
2. Open the `server.js` file in your code editor.

## Step 6: Import and Initialize Express

In the `server.js` file, we need to import the Express framework and create an instance of the Express application. Add the following code to the `server.js` file:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

Here, we import the Express module using the `require` function and assign it to the `express` variable. Then, we create an Express application by calling the `express()` function and store it in the `app` variable.

## Step 7: Set Up a Basic Route

Next, we will set up a basic route that responds with a "Hello, World!" message when the server receives a request. Add the following code to the `server.js` file:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
```

In this code, we define a route using the `app.get()` method. The first argument is the route path, `'/'`, which represents the root URL. The second argument is a callback function that takes a request object (`req`) and a response object (`res`). Inside the callback, we use the `res.send()` method to send the "Hello, World!" message as the response.

##

 Step 8: Start the Server

Finally, we need to start the server and listen for incoming requests. Add the following code to the end of the `server.js` file:

```javascript
const port = 3000; // Use any port number you prefer

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

In this code, we define a `port` variable to specify the port number on which the server should listen. You can choose any port number you prefer. Then, we call the `app.listen()` method, passing in the `port` variable and a callback function. The callback function logs a message to the console indicating that the server is running.

## Step 9: Test the Server

To test if the server is set up correctly, save the `server.js` file and go to the terminal or command prompt. Navigate to your project directory and run the following command:

```shell
node server.js
```

You should see the message "Server is running on port 3000" logged in the console. This indicates that the server is running successfully.

Open a web browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed in the browser.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a Node.js server using the Express framework.

Remember to stop the server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we set up a Node.js server using the Express framework. We installed Node.js and NPM, created a project directory, initialized a Node.js project, installed Express, created a server file, imported and initialized Express, set up a basic route, and started the server. Now you have a basic server that can handle incoming requests.

In this guide, we will create a static HTML page that will serve as the interface for displaying a list of existing projects and their associated tasks.

### Step 1: Set up the HTML Structure

Create a new HTML file and open it in your preferred code editor. Start by setting up the basic HTML structure.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Project Management App</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Project Management App</h1>
  
  <!-- Project and Task List will be added here -->
  
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: Add CSS Styles (Optional)

To improve the visual appearance of the page, you can add CSS styles. However, for this task, we will focus on the HTML structure and functionality, so CSS styles are optional.

### Step 3: Display Existing Projects and Tasks

To display a list of existing projects and their associated tasks, we can use HTML elements like `<ul>`, `<li>`, and appropriate headings.

Let's assume we have two projects with their tasks:

```plaintext
Project 1:
- Task 1
- Task 2

Project 2:
- Task 3
- Task 4
```

To represent this in HTML, add the following code inside the body of the HTML file:

```html
<div>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Project 1</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Task 1</li>
        <li>Task 2</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Project 2</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Task 3</li>
        <li>Task 4</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Step 4: Customize the Project and Task List

You can customize the project and task list by adding more HTML elements or applying CSS styles. For example, you can use different classes or IDs to target specific elements for styling or manipulation with JavaScript.

### Step 5: Save and View the HTML Page

Save the HTML file and open it in a web browser to view the static HTML page. You should now see the list of existing projects and their associated tasks displayed

# Set up the Development Environment

In this task, we will guide you through setting up the development environment for your web development project. This includes selecting an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or code editor and configuring it to work effectively with the project.

## Step 1: Choose an IDE or Code Editor

The first step is to choose an IDE or code editor that suits your preferences and supports web development. Here are a few popular options:

1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): It is a lightweight and highly customizable code editor with excellent support for web development.

2. Atom: A hackable text editor that offers a wide range of extensions and packages for web development.

3. Sublime Text: A fast and feature-rich code editor known for its speed and simplicity.

4. WebStorm: A powerful IDE specifically designed for web development with advanced features and tools.

Choose the IDE or code editor that best fits your needs and install it on your system. For the purpose of this guide, we will use Visual Studio Code.

## Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code

Follow these steps to install Visual Studio Code:

1. Visit the official Visual Studio Code website at [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Download the installation package suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Step 3: Configure Visual Studio Code

Once Visual Studio Code is installed, you can configure it to enhance your web development workflow. Here are some essential configurations:

1. Install Extensions: Visual Studio Code provides a wide range of extensions that add functionality and support for various programming languages. To install extensions, follow these steps:
   - Launch Visual Studio Code.
   - Open the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS).
   - Search for the desired extension (e.g., "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript") and click the Install button next to the extension.
   - Install extensions relevant to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other technologies you plan to use in your project.

2. Customize Settings: Visual Studio Code allows you to customize various settings according to your preferences. To access the settings, follow these steps:
   - Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
   - Type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)" and select it from the dropdown.
   - Modify the settings in the JSON file that opens to personalize your IDE, such as the font size, theme, or indentation settings.

3. Set up Integrated Terminal: Visual Studio Code includes an integrated terminal, which allows you to run commands without leaving the IDE. To open the integrated terminal, follow these steps:
   - Press `Ctrl+`<code>\`</code> (backtick) (Windows/Linux) or <code>Cmd+`</code> (backtick) (macOS).
   - The integrated terminal will open at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code window.





## Step 6: Install Necessary Dependencies

In web development projects, we often rely on various dependencies and libraries to enhance our workflow and leverage existing tools. In this step, we will install the necessary dependencies for your project, such as Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Follow these steps to install the dependencies:

1. Visit the official Node.js website at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) to download the latest LTS version of Node.js.

2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Node.js on your system.

4. Once Node.js is installed, verify its installation by opening the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code (if not already open) and executing the following command:

   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

   This command should display the installed version of Node.js.

5. Along with Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager) is also installed. Verify the installation of npm by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm --version
   ```

   This command should display the installed version of npm.

## Step 7: Set Up Basic Folder Structure

In order to organize your project files effectively, it's good practice to set up a basic folder structure. Follow these steps to create a basic folder structure for your project:

1. Inside your project directory, create a new folder called `src`. This folder will contain all the source code files for your project.

2. Create another folder called `public`. This folder will store any static assets, such as HTML files, CSS files, and images, that will be publicly accessible.

## Step 8: Create a Basic HTML File

Now, let's create a basic HTML file that will serve as the foundation for your web application. Follow these steps to create the HTML file:

1. Inside the `public` folder, create a new file called `index.html`.

2. Open the `index.html` file in Visual Studio Code.

3. Add the following code to create a basic HTML structure:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Workout Tracking App</title>
       <!-- Link your CSS and JavaScript files here -->
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to the Workout Tracking App</h

1>
       <!-- Add your content here -->
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   This code sets up a basic HTML structure with a title and a heading.

4. Save the `index.html` file.

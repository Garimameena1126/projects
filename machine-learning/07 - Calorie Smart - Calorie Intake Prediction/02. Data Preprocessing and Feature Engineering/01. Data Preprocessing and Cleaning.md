## Module 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

In this module, we will preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender), and performing feature scaling. These preprocessing steps are crucial for preparing the data before feeding it into the machine learning model. Additionally, we will perform feature engineering by creating new features or transforming existing ones that might be relevant for predicting calorie intake.

### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

Before we begin, let's import the necessary libraries that we'll be using throughout the preprocessing and feature engineering steps. We'll need the following libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset

Start by loading the dataset that contains the user data related to their characteristics, activity level, and dietary information. Assuming the dataset is in a CSV file format, we can use the `pandas` library to read it into a DataFrame.

```python
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
```

### Step 3: Handle Missing Values

Missing values in the dataset can affect the performance of our machine learning model. There are several strategies we can employ to handle missing values. In this guide, we'll use a simple approach by imputing missing values with the mean of the respective column. Follow these steps to handle missing values:

#### Identify Missing Values

```python
# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values)
```

#### Impute Missing Values

```python
# Impute missing values with the mean
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)
```

### Step 4: Encode Categorical Variables

Categorical variables, such as gender, need to be encoded into numerical values before they can be used as input for our machine learning model. We'll use the `LabelEncoder` class from `sklearn.preprocessing` to encode the categorical variables. Here's how you can encode the gender variable:

```python
# Encode categorical variable (gender)
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
df['gender_encoded'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['gender'])
```

### Step 5: Perform Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is important to ensure that all the features have a similar scale, which can improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms. We'll use the `StandardScaler` class from `sklearn.preprocessing` to perform feature scaling on the relevant variables. Follow these steps:

#### Select Features for Scaling

```python
# Select features for scaling
features_to_scale = ['age', 'weight', 'height']
```

#### Perform Feature Scaling

```python
# Perform feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[features_to_scale] = scaler.fit_transform(df[features_to_scale])
```

### Step 6: Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of our model. In this guide, let's create a new feature called "bmi" (body mass index) by combining the transformed "weight" and "height" features. Follow these steps:

```python
# Create a new feature 'bmi'
df['bmi'] = df['weight'] / (df['height'] ** 2)
```

### Step 7: Review Preprocessed Data

After performing the necessary preprocessing steps and feature engineering, it's essential to review the preprocessed data to ensure everything looks correct. You can print a sample of the preprocessed DataFrame using the following code:

```python
# Print a sample of the preprocessed data
print(df.head())
```

That's it! You have successfully preprocessed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, performing feature scaling, and conducting feature engineering.

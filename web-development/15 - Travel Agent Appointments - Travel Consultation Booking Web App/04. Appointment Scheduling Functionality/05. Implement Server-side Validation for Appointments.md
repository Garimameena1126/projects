1. **Server-side validation overview**: Server-side validation is essential to ensure the integrity and correctness of the data submitted by users. In this task, we will implement server-side validation to check if the selected time slot is available for scheduling an appointment. We'll assume that you have already set up a server and have a route to handle appointment scheduling requests.

2. **Retrieve the selected time slot**: In the server-side code responsible for handling the appointment scheduling request, retrieve the selected time slot sent by the client. The method of retrieving data from the request body or parameters will depend on the server framework or language you are using. Here's an example using Express.js in Node.js:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   
   // ...
   
   app.post('/schedule-appointment', (req, res) => {
     const selectedTimeSlot = req.body.timeSlot; // Retrieve the selected time slot from the request body
   
     // Perform server-side validation
     // ...
   });
   ```

   In the code above, we assume that the client sends the selected time slot as part of the request body parameter named `timeSlot`. Adjust the code according to your server framework and request handling method.

3. **Check time slot availability**: In the server-side validation logic, check if the selected time slot is available for scheduling an appointment. This may involve querying your database or checking against a pre-defined list of available time slots. Here's an example using a hypothetical function `isTimeSlotAvailable()`:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/schedule-appointment', (req, res) => {
     const selectedTimeSlot = req.body.timeSlot;
   
     // Perform server-side validation
     if (!isTimeSlotAvailable(selectedTimeSlot)) {
       return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Selected time slot is not available.' });
     }
   
     // Continue with appointment scheduling logic
     // ...
   });
   ```

   In the code above, we assume that the `isTimeSlotAvailable()` function checks the selected time slot against some data source (e.g., a database or predefined list) to determine its availability. If the time slot is not available, we return a response with a 400 status code and an error message indicating that the selected time slot is not available. Adjust the code based on your specific validation requirements and data source.

4. **Handle the validation result**: Depending on the outcome of the server-side validation, you can take appropriate actions. In the example above, if the selected time slot is not available, we return an error response to the client. If the time slot is available, you can proceed with the appointment scheduling logic, such as saving the appointment to the database.

5. **Test the server-side validation**: To test the server-side validation, ensure that your server is running, and send a POST request to the appropriate route (e.g., `/schedule-appointment`) with the selected time slot as part of the request body. Verify that the server correctly validates the time slot and responds accordingly.

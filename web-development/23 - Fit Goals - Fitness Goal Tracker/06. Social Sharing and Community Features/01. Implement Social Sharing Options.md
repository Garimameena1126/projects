# Beginner's Guide: Implementing Social Sharing Options

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of implementing social sharing options in your Fitness Goal Tracker web application. These options will allow users to share their progress on social media platforms. By following the step-by-step instructions below, you will be able to enable social sharing functionality and enhance the user experience of your application.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.
- An existing Fitness Goal Tracker web application with user registration and progress tracking features.

Now, let's get started with implementing social sharing options!

## Step 1: Choose Social Media Platforms and Obtain API Keys
1. Decide which social media platforms you want to support for sharing user progress. Common options include Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
2. Register as a developer on each social media platform's developer portal to obtain the necessary API keys. Follow the platform-specific documentation to create an application and obtain the API keys for your project.

## Step 2: Add Social Sharing Buttons to Progress Display
1. Identify the section of your application where you want to display the social sharing buttons, such as the progress tracking page.
2. Within the HTML code for that section, add the social media sharing buttons for each platform you selected. Here's an example of HTML code for a Facebook sharing button:
```html
<a href="#" onclick="shareOnFacebook()">Share on Facebook</a>
```
3. Repeat the above step for each social media platform you want to support, replacing the `onclick` attribute with the corresponding function name.

## Step 3: Implement Social Media Sharing Functions
1. In your JavaScript file, create a function for each social media platform you selected in Step 1. These functions will be triggered when the corresponding sharing button is clicked.
2. Inside each function, use the social media platform's API to post the user's progress information. Here's an example of JavaScript code for sharing on Facebook:
```javascript
function shareOnFacebook() {
  // Retrieve the user's progress information
  const progress = getProgress();

  // Use Facebook API to share the progress
  FB.api('/me/feed', 'post', { message: progress }, function(response) {
    if (!response || response.error) {
      console.log('Error occurred while sharing on Facebook:', response && response.error);
    } else {
      console.log('Shared on Facebook successfully!');
    }
  });
}
```
3. Repeat the above step for each social media platform, replacing the API calls and logic accordingly.

## Step 4: Load Social Media SDKs and API Libraries
1. In the HTML file, include the necessary SDKs and API libraries for each social media platform. These files will enable the communication between your application and the social media platforms' APIs.
2. Add the SDKs and libraries by including their respective script tags in the `<head>` section of your HTML file. Here's an example of including the Facebook SDK:
```html
<script src="https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v3.0"></script>
```
3. Repeat the above step for each social media platform, including their SDKs and libraries accordingly.

## Step 5: Test and Verify Social Sharing Functionality
1. Start your Fitness Goal Tracker application locally and navigate to the progress tracking page where you added the social sharing buttons.
2. Click on each social sharing button and ensure that the respective sharing function is triggered.
3. Verify that the progress information is successfully shared on each social media platform as expected.
4. Inspect the browser console for any error messages and debug as needed.

# Creating a Form to Add New Exercises

In this task, we will create a form that allows users to add new exercises to their workout log. The form will collect information such as exercise name, duration, and intensity level. Follow the steps below to create the form and implement client-side validation.

## Step 1: HTML Markup

1. Open the `index.html` file located in the `public` folder of your project.

2. Inside the `<body>` element, add the following code to create a form for adding exercises:

```html
<form id="exerciseForm">
  <h2>Add New Exercise</h2>
  <div>
    <label for="exerciseName">Exercise Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="exerciseName" name="exerciseName" required>
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="exerciseDuration">Duration (minutes):</label>
    <input type="number" id="exerciseDuration" name="exerciseDuration" required>
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="exerciseIntensity">Intensity:</label>
    <select id="exerciseIntensity" name="exerciseIntensity" required>
      <option value="">Select intensity</option>
      <option value="low">Low</option>
      <option value="medium">Medium</option>
      <option value="high">High</option>
    </select>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button type="submit">Add Exercise</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

This code creates a form with input fields for exercise name, duration, and intensity level. It also includes a submit button.

## Step 2: Client-Side Validation

To ensure that the form is filled out correctly before submitting, we will implement client-side validation using JavaScript. Follow these steps to add client-side validation to the exercise form:

1. Create a new JavaScript file called `main.js` inside the `src` folder of your project.

2. Open the `index.html` file and add the following script tag just before the closing `</body>` tag to link the JavaScript file:

```html
<script src="src/main.js"></script>
```

3. Open the `main.js` file and add the following code to validate the exercise form:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const exerciseForm = document.getElementById('exerciseForm');

  exerciseForm.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    if (validateExerciseForm()) {
      // Submit the form or perform further actions
      exerciseForm.reset();
    }
  });

  function validateExerciseForm() {
    const exerciseName = document.getElementById('exerciseName');
    const exerciseDuration = document.getElementById('exerciseDuration');
    const exerciseIntensity = document.getElementById('exerciseIntensity');

    let isValid = true;

    // Reset the previous error messages
    exerciseName.setCustomValidity('');
    exerciseDuration.setCustomValidity('');
    exerciseIntensity.setCustomValidity('');

    // Validate exercise name
    if (exerciseName.value.trim() === '') {
      exerciseName.setCustomValidity('Please enter the exercise name.');
      isValid = false;
    }

    // Validate exercise duration
    if (exerciseDuration.value <= 0) {
      exerciseDuration.setCustomValidity('Please enter a valid exercise duration.');
      isValid = false;
    }

    // Validate exercise intensity
    if (exerciseIntensity.value === '') {
      exerciseIntensity.setCustomValidity('Please select the exercise intensity.');
      isValid = false;
    }

    // Return the overall validity of the form
    return isValid;
  }
});
```

This code adds an event listener to the exercise form's submit event. It prevents the default form submission and calls the `validateExercise

Form()` function to validate the input fields. If the form is valid, the code can be extended to submit the form or perform further actions. The form is also reset after submission.

The `validateExerciseForm()` function retrieves the input field values and performs the following validation:

- Checks if the exercise name is not empty.
- Ensures that the exercise duration is a positive number.
- Verifies that an exercise intensity level is selected.

If any of the validations fail, a custom error message is set for the respective input field using the `setCustomValidity()` method. The overall validity of the form is tracked using the `isValid` variable.

## Step 3: Testing the Form

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Enter some values in the exercise form fields.

3. Try submitting the form without filling in any of the required fields or providing invalid input.

   - Ensure that error messages are displayed next to the respective input fields when validation fails.

4. Fill in the form with valid data and submit it.
    - Verify that the form submits successfully and the fields are reset after submission.

In this task, we will focus on setting up the server-side logic to store and retrieve fitness goals from a database. This will involve creating appropriate routes, handling requests, and integrating with a database system.

## Step 1: Set up the Server Environment

Before we begin implementing the server-side logic, let's set up the server environment using Node.js and Express.js. Follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org). Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

2. Create a new project directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired location where you want to create your project. Use the following command to create a new directory for your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir fitness-goal-tracker
    cd fitness-goal-tracker
    ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project: Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project in the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

This will create a `package.json` file that will keep track of your project's dependencies.

4. Install Express.js: Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js. Install it by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```

5. Create a new file named `server.js` in the project directory. This file will serve as the entry point for our server-side code.

## Step 2: Set up Express.js Server

In this step, we will configure an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests and responses.

1. Open the `server.js` file in your preferred text editor.

2. Import the required modules at the top of the file:

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; // Set the port number
    ```

3. Define a basic route to test if the server is running:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Server is running successfully!');
});
```

4. Start the server by adding the following code at the end of the file:

    ```javascript
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

## Step 3: Connect to the Database

In this step, we will connect our application to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.

1. Install Mongoose: Run the following command to install Mongoose:

    ```bash
    npm install mongoose
    ```

2. Import the Mongoose module at the top of the `server.js` file:

    ```javascript
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    ```

3. Connect to the MongoDB database by adding the following code after the server setup code:

    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/fitness-goals', {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    })
      .then(() => {
        console.log('Connected to the database');
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error('Error connecting to the database:', err);
      });
    ```

This code connects to a local MongoDB database named 'fitness-goals'. Adjust the connection URL according to your MongoDB configuration.

## Step 4: Define a Fitness Goal Schema and Model

In this step, we will define a Mongoose schema and model for the fitness goals.

1. Add the following code after the database connection code:
    
    ```javascript
    const fitnessGoalSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
      goalType: String,
      targetMetrics: {
        weight: Number,
        reps: Number,
        distance: Number,
     
    
     },
    });
    
    const FitnessGoal = mongoose.model('FitnessGoal', fitnessGoalSchema);
    ```

This code defines a schema with `goalType` and `targetMetrics` fields. Adjust the schema according to your fitness goal requirements.

## Step 5: Handle POST Requests to Create Fitness Goals

Now, we will handle the POST request to create fitness goals and save them in the database.

1. Add the following code after the fitness goal schema and model:

    ```javascript
    app.use(express.json()); // Enable JSON request body parsing
    
    app.post('/fitness-goals', (req, res) => {
      const goalData = req.body;
    
      const newFitnessGoal = new FitnessGoal(goalData);
      newFitnessGoal.save()
        .then((savedGoal) => {
          res.status(201).json(savedGoal);
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to save the fitness goal' });
        });
    });
    ```

This code sets up a route to handle POST requests to `/fitness-goals`. It extracts the goal data from the request body, creates a new `FitnessGoal` instance, and saves it in the database.

## Step 6: Handle GET Requests to Retrieve Fitness Goals

Lastly, we will handle the GET request to retrieve fitness goals from the database.

1. Add the following code after the POST request handler:

    ```javascript
    app.get('/fitness-goals', (req, res) => {
      FitnessGoal.find()
        .then((goals) => {
          res.status(200).json(goals);
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve fitness goals' });
        });
    });
    ```

This code sets up a route to handle GET requests to `/fitness-goals`. It retrieves all fitness goals from the database and sends them as a JSON response.

## Step 7: Start the Server

Now, let's start the server and test the implementation.

1. Save the `server.js` file.

2. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

3. If there are no errors, you should see the following message:

    ```
    Server is running on port 3000
    Connected to the database
    ```

## Step 8: Test the Endpoints

You can now test the server endpoints using a tool like Postman or cURL.

1. To create a fitness goal, send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/fitness-goals` with the following JSON body:

    ```json
    {
      "goalType": "weight loss",
      "targetMetrics": {
        "weight": 70,
        "reps": 10,
        "distance": 5
      }
    }
    ```

2. To retrieve all fitness goals, send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/fitness-goals`.

Make sure to adjust the URL and request body according to your development environment.

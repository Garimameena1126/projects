## Set up the Mobile Development Environment and Required Dependencies

In this guide, we will set up the mobile development environment and install the necessary dependencies to build the workout tracking app using a cross-platform mobile development framework. We will assume that you have already selected a framework, such as React Native or Flutter, for building the mobile app.

### Step 1: Install Node.js

1. Go to the official Node.js website at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) in your web browser.

2. Download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Node.js for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Node.js on your computer.

4. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:

   ```shell
   node --version
   ```

   It should display the installed version of Node.js.

### Step 2: Install a Code Editor

1. Choose a code editor for development. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text.

2. Go to the official website of your chosen code editor and download the installer for your operating system.

3. Run the installer and follow the instructions to install the code editor on your computer.

### Step 3: Set up the Mobile Development Platform

#### React Native

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Install React Native globally by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install -g react-native-cli
   ```

#### Flutter

1. Go to the official Flutter website at [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev) in your web browser.

2. Download the Flutter SDK for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. Extract the downloaded archive to a preferred location on your computer.

4. Add the Flutter SDK to your system's `PATH` environment variable:

   - Windows:
     - Open the Control Panel and search for "Environment Variables."
     - Click on "Edit the system environment variables."
     - Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
     - In the "System variables" section, select the "Path" variable and click "Edit."
     - Click "New" and add the path to the `flutter/bin` directory, e.g., `C:\flutter\bin`.
     - Click "OK" to save the changes.

   - macOS/Linux:
     - Open a terminal.
     - Run the following command to open your shell profile file:

       ```shell
       nano ~/.bash_profile
       ```

     - Add the following line to the file and save it:

       ```shell
       export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
       ```

       Replace `[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_DIRECTORY]` with the actual path to the Flutter SDK directory.

     - Run the following command to load the modified profile:

       ```shell
       source ~/.bash_profile
       ```

5. Verify the Flutter installation by running the following command:

   ```shell
   flutter --version
   ```

   It should display the installed version of Flutter.

### Step 4: Create a New Mobile App Project

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your mobile app project.

3. Create a new React Native project by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npx react-native init WorkoutTracker
   ```

   Replace "WorkoutTracker" with your desired project name.

   **OR**

   Create a new Flutter project by running the following command:

   ```shell
   flutter create WorkoutTracker
   ```

   Replace "WorkoutTracker" with your desired project name.

4. Wait for the project scaffolding to complete.

### Step 5: Start the Mobile App Development Server

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your mobile app project.

3. Start the development server for React Native by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npx react-native start
   ```

   The development server will compile your app and provide a bundle that can be loaded onto the device or emulator.

   **OR**

   Start the development server for Flutter by running the following command:

   ```shell
   flutter run
   ```

   This command will build and run your app on the connected device or emulator.

In this task, we will create a basic folder structure for our project to organize the different files and assets effectively. A well-structured folder hierarchy will make it easier to locate and manage the project's resources. Follow the steps below to complete this task:

## Step 1: Set Up the Project Repository and Version Control System

Before creating the folder structure, make sure you have set up the project repository and version control system as described in the previous task. This will ensure that you have a local repository to track your project's changes.

## Step 2: Identify the Required Folders

Take a moment to plan the folder structure based on your project's requirements. In this guide, we will create three main folders: `src`, `public`, and `styles`. The `src` folder will contain the source code and assets related to the project's functionality, while the `public` folder will hold static files accessible to the public, such as HTML files, images, and fonts. The `styles` folder will store CSS files for styling the project. Feel free to add additional folders if needed for your specific project requirements.

## Step 3: Create the Folders

1. Open your project's root directory in your preferred code editor or file explorer.
2. Create the `src` folder by right-clicking on the root directory, selecting "New Folder," and entering the name `src`.
3. Similarly, create the `public` and `styles` folders within the root directory.

At this point, your folder structure should look like this:

```
- project-root
  - src
  - public
  - styles
```

## Step 4: Add Sample Files (Optional)

To demonstrate the purpose of each folder, let's add some sample files.

1. Inside the `src` folder, create a new file called `index.js` by right-clicking on the `src` folder, selecting "New File," and entering the name `index.js`.
   ```javascript
   // index.js
   
   // Entry point of the JavaScript code
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   ```
2. In the `public` folder, create an `index.html` file with the following content:
   ```html
   <!-- index.html -->
   
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>My Project</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/style.css" />
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My Project!</h1>
       <script src="../src/index.js"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```
3. Finally, inside the `styles` folder, create a CSS file named `style.css`:
   ```css
   /* style.css */
   
   body {
     background-color: #f2f2f2;
     font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
   }
   
   h1 {
     color: #333;
     text-align: center;
   }
   ```

## Step 5: Verify the Folder Structure

At this point, you should have the following folder structure along with the sample files:

```
- project-root
  - src
    - index.js
  - public
    - index.html
  - styles
    - style.css
```

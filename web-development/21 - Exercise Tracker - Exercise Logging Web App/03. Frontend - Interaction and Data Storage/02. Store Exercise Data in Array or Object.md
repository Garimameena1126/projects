# Step-by-Step Guide: Store Exercise Data in an Array or Object

In this task, we will implement the functionality to store the exercise data captured from the form submission in either an array or an object. Storing the data will allow us to keep track of the logged exercises. Follow the step-by-step guide below to implement this feature.

## Prerequisites

- HTML knowledge
- JavaScript basics
- Code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed

## Steps

1. **Open Code Editor**

   Launch your preferred code editor or IDE.

2. **Open the JavaScript File**

   Open the JavaScript file that corresponds to the HTML file containing the exercise logging form.

3. **Declare an Array or Object**

   In the JavaScript file, declare an empty array or object to store the exercise data. You can choose either based on your project's requirements.

   ```javascript
   // Declare an empty array to store exercise data
   const exerciseData = [];

   // OR

   // Declare an empty object to store exercise data
   const exerciseData = {};
   ```

   In this example, we declare an empty array `exerciseData` to store the exercise data. Alternatively, you can use an empty object `exerciseData` if you prefer to store the data as key-value pairs.

4. **Update the `handleFormSubmission()` Function**

   Locate the `handleFormSubmission()` function that handles the form submission in your JavaScript file. Update the function to include code that adds the captured form data to the `exerciseData` array or object.

   ```javascript
   function handleFormSubmission(event) {
     event.preventDefault();

     // Retrieve the form input values
     const exerciseNameInput = document.getElementById('exercise-name');
     const setsInput = document.getElementById('sets');
     const repsInput = document.getElementById('reps');

     const exerciseName = exerciseNameInput.value;
     const sets = setsInput.value;
     const reps = repsInput.value;

     // Create an exercise object with the captured form data
     const exercise = {
       exerciseName,
       sets,
       reps
     };

     // Add the exercise object to the exerciseData array or object
     exerciseData.push(exercise);

     // Clear the form input fields
     exerciseNameInput.value = '';
     setsInput.value = '';
     repsInput.value = '';

     // Update the UI to display the logged exercises
     // ...
   }
   ```

   In this example, we create an `exercise` object using the captured form data. The object contains properties such as `exerciseName`, `sets`, and `reps`. We then add this `exercise` object to the `exerciseData` array using the `push()` method. If you are using an object instead of an array, replace `push()` with appropriate code to add the exercise object as a property to the `exerciseData` object.

5. **Test the Application**

   Open the HTML file in a web browser and test the form submission functionality. Fill in the exercise logging form with some values, submit it, and verify that the exercise data is being stored in the `exerciseData` array or object. You can use `console.log()` statements to output the contents of the `exerciseData` variable and ensure that the data is being stored correctly.

6. **Summary**

   Congratulations! You have successfully implemented the functionality to store exercise data in an array or object. The captured form data is now being added to the `exerciseData` variable, allowing you to keep track of the logged exercises.

   Remember to save your files and keep a backup of your code before proceeding to the next task.

# Visualizing Feature Importances for Flight Price Prediction

In this guide, we will focus on analyzing the importance of different features in predicting flight prices. By examining the feature importances provided by the selected machine learning model, we can gain insights into which factors have the most significant impact on flight prices. We will also learn how to visualize these feature importances for better understanding.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have completed the previous modules and have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python installed on your system
- Python libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (you can install them using `pip` or `conda`)

## Step 1: Load the Trained Model

To visualize the feature importances, we first need to have a trained machine learning model. If you haven't trained a model yet, please refer to the previous modules on model selection and training.

Assuming you have a trained model saved as a file (e.g., `flight_price_model.pkl`), we will start by loading the model into our Python environment:

```python
import pickle

# Load the trained model
with open('flight_price_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)
```

## Step 2: Retrieve Feature Importances

Next, we need to retrieve the feature importances from the trained model. The approach for accessing feature importances may vary depending on the type of model used.

For example, if you trained a Random Forest model, you can retrieve the feature importances as follows:

```python
# Retrieve feature importances from the Random Forest model
importances = model.feature_importances_
```

Replace `model` with the name of your trained model.

If you used a different type of model, such as Gradient Boosting or Linear Regression, please refer to the documentation of the respective library to learn how to retrieve feature importances specific to that model.

## Step 3: Prepare Feature Names

To create a meaningful visualization of feature importances, we need to associate each feature importance score with its corresponding feature name. Ensure that you have the list of feature names used during training.

```python
# Assuming you have a list of feature names
feature_names = ['departure_airport', 'arrival_airport', 'date', 'airline', 'day_of_week', 'time_of_day']
```

Replace `feature_names` with your actual list of feature names.

## Step 4: Visualize Feature Importances

Now that we have the feature importances and their corresponding feature names, we can proceed with visualizing them. We'll use the matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create a bar plot for better visualization.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create a dataframe with feature names and importances
feature_importances = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': feature_names, 'Importance': importances})

# Sort the dataframe by feature importances in descending order
feature_importances = feature_importances.sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)

# Create a horizontal bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Importance', y='Feature', data=feature_importances, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Feature Importances')
plt.xlabel('Importance')
plt.ylabel('Feature')
plt.show()
```

The code above creates a horizontal bar plot, where each feature is represented by a bar, and its corresponding importance score is represented on the x-axis. The features are sorted in descending order based on their importance.

## Step 5: Interpret the Feature Importances

Once we have the feature importances visualized, we can interpret the results to gain insights into which factors have the most significant impact on flight prices.

In the bar

 plot, features with higher importance scores indicate a stronger influence on flight prices. Conversely, features with lower importance scores have a relatively weaker impact.

Analyze the plot and look for the most important features based on their corresponding importance scores. These features play a crucial role in predicting flight prices.

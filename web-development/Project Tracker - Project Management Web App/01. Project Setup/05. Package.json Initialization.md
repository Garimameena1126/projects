
## Initialize a package.json File for Managing Dependencies

In this guide, we will initialize a `package.json` file in the project management app folder. The `package.json` file is used to manage the project's dependencies and configuration.

### Step 1: Open the Project Folder

Open the project folder "project-management-app" in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code. This is the folder where we will initialize the `package.json` file.

### Step 2: Open the Integrated Terminal

Open the integrated terminal in your code editor. This terminal will be used to run the necessary commands.

### Step 3: Initialize a `package.json` File

To initialize a `package.json` file, run the following command in the integrated terminal:

```shell
npm init
```

This command will prompt you to provide information about the project, such as the package name, version, description, entry point, and more. You can press Enter to accept the default values or provide your own.

For example:

```plaintext
name: (project-management-app)
version: (1.0.0)
description: A project management app
entry point: (index.js)
...
```

Once you have provided the necessary information, press Enter to confirm the configuration.

### Step 4: Verify the `package.json` File

After running the `npm init` command, a `package.json` file will be created in the project folder with the specified configuration. You can verify that the file exists and contains the project details.

Open the `package.json` file in your code editor to view its contents. It should look similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "name": "project-management-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A project management app",
  "main": "index.js",
  ...
}
```

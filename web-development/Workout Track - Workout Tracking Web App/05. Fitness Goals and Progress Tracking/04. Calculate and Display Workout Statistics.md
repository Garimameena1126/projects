In this task, we will implement the functionality to calculate and display statistics related to the user's workout data, such as calories burned. This will provide valuable insights and feedback to the user regarding their fitness progress. Follow the step-by-step guide below to accomplish this task.

## Step 1: Retrieve Workout Data

Before we can calculate statistics, we need to retrieve the user's workout data from the database. Ensure that you have already implemented the functionality to store workout data and associate it with the logged-in user. Here's an example of how you can retrieve workout data using a database query:

```javascript
// Assuming you have a function to retrieve workout data from the database
const workoutData = retrieveWorkoutData(userId);
```

The `workoutData` variable will contain the retrieved workout data for the logged-in user.

## Step 2: Calculate Calories Burned

To calculate the calories burned during a workout, we need to consider various factors such as the duration of the workout, the intensity of the exercises, and the user's weight. Here's a simplified example of how you can calculate calories burned using a formula:

```javascript
const calculateCaloriesBurned = (duration, intensity, weight) => {
  // Assuming a formula to calculate calories burned
  const caloriesPerMinute = 5; // Placeholder value, replace with your formula
  const caloriesBurned = duration * caloriesPerMinute * intensity * weight;
  return caloriesBurned;
};
```

In this example, `duration` represents the duration of the workout in minutes, `intensity` represents the intensity of the workout (e.g., low, medium, high), and `weight` represents the user's weight in kilograms.

Adjust the formula based on your specific requirements and fitness calculations.

## Step 3: Display Statistics

Now that we have calculated the calories burned for the user's workout data, we can display the statistics to the user. You can choose an appropriate section of your user interface to show the statistics. Here's an example of how you can display the calories burned using HTML and JavaScript:

```html
<div id="calories-burned-container"></div>

<script>
const caloriesBurnedContainer = document.getElementById('calories-burned-container');

// Assuming you have the retrieved workout data and the calculateCaloriesBurned function from previous steps
workoutData.forEach((workout) => {
  const caloriesBurned = calculateCaloriesBurned(workout.duration, workout.intensity, user.weight);
  
  const workoutStats = document.createElement('p');
  workoutStats.textContent = `Workout: ${workout.name}, Calories Burned: ${caloriesBurned}`;
  caloriesBurnedContainer.appendChild(workoutStats);
});
</script>
```

In this example, we create a container element with the ID `calories-burned-container` to hold the workout statistics. For each workout in the retrieved workout data, we calculate the calories burned using the `calculateCaloriesBurned` function and create a paragraph element to display the workout name and calories burned. Finally, we append the workout statistics to the container.

Adjust the HTML and JavaScript code according to your project's structure and requirements.

## Step 4: Additional Statistics

Apart from calories burned, you can also calculate and display additional statistics related to the user's workout data. Some examples include:

- Total workout duration
- Average intensity of workouts
- Distance covered
- Number of workouts completed

You can use similar approaches to calculate and display these statistics based on the available workout data.

## Step 5: Test and Iterate

After implementing the calculation and display of workout statistics, thoroughly test your application to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the calculated statistics. You may need to make adjustments to the formulas or presentation based on user feedback and testing results.

#### Task: Access the container element in the HTML file using JavaScript.

1. Open the previously created "index.html" file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Locate the `<body>` tag within the HTML file. This is where we'll add the container element that will hold the class names.
3. Decide on an appropriate HTML element to use as the container. For this example, let's use a `<div>` element. Add the following code inside the `<body>` tag:

```html
<body>
    <div id="class-container"></div>
</body>
```

Explanation:
- The `<div>` element is a versatile container that allows us to group and manipulate other elements.
- We've added an `id` attribute with the value "class-container" to uniquely identify this element. The `id` attribute will be used to access this container element in JavaScript.

4. Save the "index.html" file.

Now, let's proceed to the JavaScript part to access this container element.

5. Create a new JavaScript file in the project directory and name it "script.js".
6. Link the "script.js" file to the "index.html" file by adding the following code inside the `<head>` section of the "index.html" file:

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Class Schedule</title>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
```

Explanation:
- The `<script>` tag is used to include JavaScript code in the HTML file.
- The `src` attribute specifies the file path to the JavaScript file. In this case, we've set it to "script.js" since both files are in the same directory.

7. Switch to the "script.js" file and add the following code:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const classContainer = document.getElementById('class-container');
  console.log(classContainer);
});
```

Explanation:
- We're using the `addEventListener` method to listen for the 'DOMContentLoaded' event. This ensures that the JavaScript code runs after the HTML content has finished loading.
- Inside the event listener, we're using the `document.getElementById` method to retrieve the container element with the specified `id` attribute value, which is 'class-container'.
- The obtained container element is stored in the `classContainer` variable.
- The `console.log` statement outputs the `classContainer` variable to the browser console for verification purposes.

8. Save the "script.js" file.

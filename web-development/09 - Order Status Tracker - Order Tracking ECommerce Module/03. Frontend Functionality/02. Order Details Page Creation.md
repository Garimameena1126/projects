# Creating a Page to Display Order Details

In this task, we will create a page to display the order details, including the order number and customer information. Follow the steps below to implement this feature.

## Step 1: Create a New Component

Start by creating a new component that will represent the page to display the order details. In this example, we'll name the component `OrderDetailsPage`.

Create a new file named `OrderDetailsPage.js` in your project's component directory (e.g., `src/components`). Add the following code to define the component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const OrderDetailsPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Order Details</h2>
      {/* Display order details here */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default OrderDetailsPage;
```

In this code, we have defined the `OrderDetailsPage` component, which renders a heading (`<h2>Order Details</h2>`) and a placeholder where we will display the actual order details.

## Step 2: Pass Order Details as Props

To display the order details dynamically, we need to pass them as props to the `OrderDetailsPage` component. This allows us to reuse the component for different orders.

In the parent component or the component responsible for managing the order data, import the `OrderDetailsPage` component and pass the relevant order details as props. For example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import OrderDetailsPage from './components/OrderDetailsPage';

const App = () => {
  const order = {
    orderNumber: '123456',
    customerName: 'John Doe',
    // Add more order details as needed
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other components */}
      <OrderDetailsPage order={order} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this code, we have created an `order` object with sample order details and passed it to the `OrderDetailsPage` component as the `order` prop.

## Step 3: Access and Display Order Details

Now that we have passed the order details as props, we can access them in the `OrderDetailsPage` component and display them accordingly.

Update the `OrderDetailsPage` component to include the order details:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const OrderDetailsPage = ({ order }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Order Details</h2>
      <p>Order Number: {order.orderNumber}</p>
      <p>Customer Name: {order.customerName}</p>
      {/* Add more order details */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default OrderDetailsPage;
```

In this code, we are accessing the `order` prop and displaying the order number and customer name using JSX expressions (`{}`).

Feel free to add more order details or customize the display based on your project requirements.

## Step 4: Style the Order Details Page

To enhance the visual appearance of the order details page, you can apply CSS styles to the component. You can either use inline styles or define a separate CSS file and import it into the component.

For example, you can add the following inline styles to the `OrderDetailsPage` component to provide basic formatting:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const OrderDetailsPage = ({ order }) => {
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5' }}>
      <h2 style={{ marginBottom: '10px' }}>Order Details</h2>
      <p>Order Number: {order.orderNumber}</p>
      <p>Customer Name: {order.customer

Name}</p>
      {/* Add more order details */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default OrderDetailsPage;
```

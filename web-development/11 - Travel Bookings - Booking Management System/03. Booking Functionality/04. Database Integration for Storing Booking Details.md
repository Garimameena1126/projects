1. Ensure you have set up a backend server using a framework of your choice (e.g., Node.js with Express) and have MongoDB installed and running. If not, refer to the previous guide on setting up a backend server and installing MongoDB.

2. Open your preferred code editor and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the necessary dependencies for MongoDB integration. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```shell
   npm install mongoose
   ```

4. Open the file where you defined the route for booking creation (e.g., `routes/bookings.js`).

5. Import the required modules at the top of the file:
   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   ```

6. Connect to your MongoDB database by adding the following code snippet at the beginning of your route file or in a separate database configuration file:
   ```javascript
   mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name', {
     useNewUrlParser: true,
     useUnifiedTopology: true,
   });

   const db = mongoose.connection;
   db.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'MongoDB connection error:'));
   db.once('open', () => {
     console.log('Connected to the MongoDB database');
   });
   ```

   Replace `'mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name'` with the appropriate connection URL for your MongoDB instance. Ensure the URL includes the correct database name.

7. Create a Mongoose schema to define the structure of the booking document. Above the booking creation route, add the following code:
   ```javascript
   const bookingSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     userId: String,
     packageId: String,
     startDate: Date,
     endDate: Date,
   });

   const Booking = mongoose.model('Booking', bookingSchema);
   ```

8. Modify the booking creation route to save the booking details to the database. Update the existing route code as follows:
   ```javascript
   router.post('/bookings', (req, res) => {
     // Extract booking data from the request body
     const { userId, packageId, startDate, endDate } = req.body;
     
     // Validate the booking data
     // Perform necessary checks, such as checking for available slots, user authentication, etc.
     
     // If the booking data is valid, proceed with booking creation
     const newBooking = new Booking({
       userId,
       packageId,
       startDate,
       endDate,
     });
     
     // Save the new booking to the database
     newBooking.save((err) => {
       if (err) {
         console.error('Error saving booking:', err);
         res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to create booking' });
       } else {
         res.status(200).json({ message: 'Booking created successfully!' });
       }
     });
   });
   ```

9. Save the file.

10. Start your backend server if it's not already running.

11. Your booking details will now be stored in the MongoDB database when a booking is created. You can verify this by making a booking through your frontend application or using an API testing tool such as Postman.

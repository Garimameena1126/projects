Sure! Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to preprocess the user input by applying the same cleaning and formatting techniques used during training:

## Preprocessing User Input for Email Classification

In this task, we will preprocess the user input email by applying the same cleaning and formatting techniques used during training. This ensures that the input data is in the same format as the training data, allowing us to make accurate predictions.

### Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

Before we start preprocessing the user input, let's import the required libraries:

```python
import re
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
```

### Step 2: Define the preprocessing function

Next, we will define a function that performs the necessary preprocessing steps on the user input. This function will clean the text, convert it to lowercase, remove stop words, and lemmatize the words. 

```python
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Remove unnecessary characters
    text = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text)
    
    # Convert text to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    
    # Tokenize the text into words
    words = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    
    # Remove stop words
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]
    
    # Lemmatize words
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]
    
    # Join the words back into a single string
    preprocessed_text = ' '.join(words)
    
    return preprocessed_text
```

Let's go through each step of the preprocessing function:

- We use regular expressions (`re.sub`) to remove any characters that are not alphabets.
- The text is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function.
- The text is tokenized into individual words using the `nltk.word_tokenize()` function.
- Stop words, such as "the," "is," and "and," are removed using a predefined set of English stop words from the NLTK library.
- The remaining words are lemmatized using the WordNet lemmatizer from the NLTK library.
- Finally, the preprocessed words are joined back into a single string using the `join()` function.

### Step 3: Preprocess the user input

Now that we have the preprocessing function in place, let's preprocess the user input email before making predictions.

```python
# Assume the user input is stored in a variable called 'user_input'
user_input = "Hey, check out this amazing offer! Limited time offer. Buy now!"

# Preprocess the user input using the preprocessing function
preprocessed_input = preprocess_text(user_input)
```

The `preprocess_text()` function is called with the user input as the argument. The function returns the preprocessed text, which is stored in the `preprocessed_input` variable.

### Step 4: Use the preprocessed input for prediction

Finally, we can use the preprocessed input to make predictions using the trained model. The exact implementation of this step will depend on the specific machine learning algorithm or framework you are using. Here's a generic example:

```python
# Assuming 'model' is the trained machine learning model

# Perform any additional necessary preprocessing steps specific to your model

# Make predictions using the preprocessed input
prediction = model.predict([preprocessed_input])

# Assuming the prediction is binary (spam or non-spam), we can display the result
if prediction[0] == 1:
    print("The input email is classified as spam.")
else:
    print("

The input email is classified as non-spam.")
```

Make sure to replace `'model'` with the variable or object representing your trained machine learning model. Adjust the prediction display logic based on the specific output format of your model.

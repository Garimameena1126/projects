
## Create a New Project Folder and Initialize it as a Git Repository

To start your web development project, you need to create a new project folder and set it up as a Git repository. This guide will walk you through the process:

### Step 1: Choose a Location for Your Project Folder

First, decide where you want to create your project folder on your computer. Choose a location that is easily accessible and where you can organize your files effectively.

For example, you might choose to create your project folder on your desktop or within a specific directory on your computer. Remember this location as we'll use it in the following steps.

### Step 2: Create the Project Folder

Now that you have decided on a location, follow these steps to create the project folder:

1. Open your preferred file explorer or terminal.
2. Navigate to the desired location where you want to create your project folder.
3. Right-click within the location and select "New Folder" (or a similar option based on your operating system).
4. Provide a name for your project folder. For example, you can name it "lead-management-system" or any name you prefer.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your project folder.

### Step 3: Initialize the Git Repository

Next, you need to initialize your project folder as a Git repository. This will enable version control for your project and allow you to track changes.

To initialize the Git repository, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the current directory to your project folder by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project-folder
   ```

   Replace `path/to/your/project-folder` with the actual path to your project folder. For example, if your project folder is on the desktop, you can use:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/lead-management-system
   ```

3. Once you are inside your project folder, run the following command to initialize the Git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

   This command will create a hidden `.git` folder within your project folder, which stores the necessary Git files.

Congratulations! You have successfully initialized your project folder as a Git repository.

### Step 4: Verify the Git Repository

To verify that the Git repository was initialized correctly, you can use the `git status` command. This command shows the current status of your repository and any untracked files.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git status
```

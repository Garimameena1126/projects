# Implementing Pagination Functionality to Display Limited Number of Products per Page

In this guide, we will focus on implementing pagination functionality to display a limited number of products per page on the product listing page. This will help improve the user experience and prevent overwhelming the page with a large number of products.

## Step 1: Determine the Number of Products to Display per Page

1. Decide on the number of products you want to display per page. Let's assume we want to display 10 products per page.
2. Store this value in a variable, such as `productsPerPage`, which you can modify later if needed.

## Step 2: Update the Backend API Endpoint

1. Open your backend API endpoint code where you fetch and return the product data.
2. Add functionality to handle pagination parameters in the API endpoint URL. This will allow the client to specify the page number and the number of products per page.
3. Extract the page number and the products per page from the API endpoint URL parameters.
4. Modify the logic to return a subset of products based on the page number and the products per page. For example, if the page number is 1 and there are 100 products with 10 products per page, return the first 10 products.
5. Update the API response to include additional information about the total number of products and the total number of pages available.

## Step 3: Update the Product Listing Page

1. Open your HTML file containing the product listing page (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Locate the section where the product list is rendered.
3. Add HTML elements to display the pagination controls. For example, you can add a `<div>` element with the class "pagination" below the product list.
4. Inside the pagination `<div>`, add HTML elements to represent the page numbers and the navigation buttons. You can use `<a>` tags or `<button>` elements for the navigation buttons.
5. Apply CSS styling to the pagination controls to make them visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Step 4: Implement Pagination Logic in JavaScript

1. Open the JavaScript file associated with your HTML file (e.g., `script.js`).
2. Write a JavaScript function to handle the pagination logic. This function will be responsible for fetching the product data for a specific page and updating the product listing accordingly.
3. Inside the pagination function, make a request to your backend API endpoint with the appropriate pagination parameters (e.g., page number and products per page).
4. Update the product listing on the page with the retrieved data.
5. Update the pagination controls to reflect the current page and allow navigation to other pages.
6. Attach event listeners to the pagination controls (e.g., the page numbers and navigation buttons) to trigger the pagination function when clicked.
7. Call the pagination function initially to display the first page of products.

## Step 5: Customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as Needed

1. Customize the HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript logic to fit your project requirements.
2. Modify the design and layout of the pagination controls to match your desired user interface.
3. Update the JavaScript code to handle any additional functionality or features you want to implement.

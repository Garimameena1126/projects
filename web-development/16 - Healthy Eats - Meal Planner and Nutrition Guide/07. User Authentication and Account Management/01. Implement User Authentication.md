## Implementing User Authentication Functionality

To enhance your meal planner application, you will implement user authentication functionality using a suitable authentication library or framework. This will allow users to create accounts, log in, and securely access their personalized information. Follow this step-by-step guide to implement user authentication in your project.

### Step 1: Choose an Authentication Library/Framework

The first step is to choose a suitable authentication library or framework that aligns with the technology stack you're using for your project. Some popular options include Passport.js for Node.js applications and Django's built-in authentication for Python-based applications. Research and select the one that best fits your project requirements and follow its documentation for implementation details.

For the purpose of this guide, we'll assume you choose to use Passport.js for authentication in your Node.js application.

### Step 2: Install and Configure Passport.js

1. Install the necessary dependencies for Passport.js by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install passport passport-local express-session
```

2. Create a new file, `passportConfig.js`, and require the necessary modules:

```javascript
const passport = require('passport');
const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;
const session = require('express-session');
```

3. Set up session middleware in your application to handle user sessions. Add the following code to your main application file (e.g., `app.js`):

```javascript
app.use(session({
  secret: 'your_session_secret',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false
}));
```

Make sure to replace `'your_session_secret'` with a secure secret key for session management.

4. Configure Passport.js to use the LocalStrategy for username/password authentication. Add the following code to `passportConfig.js`:

```javascript
passport.use(new LocalStrategy(
  {
    usernameField: 'email', // Assuming email is used as the username field
    passwordField: 'password'
  },
  (email, password, done) => {
    // Replace with your actual authentication logic
    User.findOne({ email }, (err, user) => {
      if (err) { return done(err); }
      if (!user) {
        return done(null, false, { message: 'Invalid email or password' });
      }
      if (!user.verifyPassword(password)) {
        return done(null, false, { message: 'Invalid email or password' });
      }
      return done(null, user);
    });
  }
));
```

Ensure that you replace the authentication logic with your own implementation. This example assumes you have a `User` model and a `verifyPassword()` method for password verification.

### Step 3: Create Login and Registration Pages

Next, you need to create the login and registration pages in your application. These pages will allow users to enter their credentials and authenticate themselves. Use HTML, CSS, and your preferred templating engine (e.g., EJS, Pug) to create the necessary forms and handle form submission.

Here's an example of a login form:

```html
<form action="/login" method="POST">
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
  <button type="submit">Log In</button>
</form>
```

Similarly, create a registration form with appropriate input fields for email, password, and any additional information you require from users.

### Step 4: Implement Authentication Routes

Now, you need to implement the authentication routes in your application to handle user authentication requests.

1. Create a new file, `authRoutes

.js`, and require the necessary modules:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const passport = require('passport');
const router = express.Router();
```

2. Define the routes for login and registration:

```javascript
// Login route
router.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', {
  successRedirect: '/dashboard', // Replace with your actual success redirect URL
  failureRedirect: '/login', // Replace with your actual failure redirect URL
  failureFlash: true
}));

// Registration route
router.post('/register', (req, res) => {
  // Replace with your actual registration logic
  res.redirect('/login'); // Redirect to the login page after successful registration
});
```

Ensure that you replace the success and failure redirect URLs with the appropriate URLs in your application.

3. Export the router:

```javascript
module.exports = router;
```

### Step 5: Mount Authentication Routes

Finally, mount the authentication routes in your main application file (`app.js`) using the appropriate route prefix:

```javascript
const authRoutes = require('./authRoutes');

app.use('/auth', authRoutes);
```

In this example, the authentication routes will be accessible at `/auth/login` and `/auth/register`. Adjust the route prefix as per your preference.

### Step 6: Protect Authenticated Routes

If you have specific routes that should only be accessible to authenticated users, you can protect them using middleware. For example:

```javascript
const requireAuth = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/login'); // Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page
};

app.get('/dashboard', requireAuth, (req, res) => {
  // Handle authenticated user's dashboard
});
```

In this example, the `/dashboard` route is protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users. Adjust the route and the redirect URL as needed.


## Create a New Folder for the Project

1. Open your preferred file explorer or terminal, depending on your operating system.

2. Navigate to the desired location where you want to create the project folder. This could be your desktop, documents folder, or any other location of your choice.

3. Right-click in the desired location and select "New Folder" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the command line to create a new folder. For example, on a Mac or Linux system, you can use the following command:

   ```
   mkdir project-folder
   ```

   Replace `project-folder` with the desired name for your project folder.

4. Give the folder a meaningful and descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your project. For example, you can name it "travel-booking-form" to align with the project's context.

5. Press Enter or click outside the folder to save the new folder with the specified name.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new folder for your project. Now, let's proceed to the next step.

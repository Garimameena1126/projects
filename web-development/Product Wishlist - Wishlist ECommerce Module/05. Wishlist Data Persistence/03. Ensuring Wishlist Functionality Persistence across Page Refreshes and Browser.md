1. Open the JavaScript file associated with your project.

2. Locate the section where you handle the wishlist functionality.

3. Modify the code to persist the wishlist data to local storage whenever a change is made to the wishlist. This ensures that the data is saved and can be retrieved even after page refreshes or browser restarts. Here's an example code snippet:

   ```javascript
   function persistWishlistToLocalStorage() {
     localStorage.setItem('wishlist', JSON.stringify(wishlist));
   }
   ```

   In the code above, we use the `localStorage.setItem()` method to store the wishlist data in local storage. We convert the `wishlist` array to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()` before saving it.

4. Update the code wherever the wishlist is modified to call the `persistWishlistToLocalStorage()` function. For example, if you have an event handler for adding a product to the wishlist, modify it as follows:

   ```javascript
   function addToWishlist(product) {
     wishlist.push(product);
     // Other logic for adding the product to the wishlist
     persistWishlistToLocalStorage(); // Call the function to persist the wishlist data
   }
   ```

   By adding the `persistWishlistToLocalStorage()` function call after modifying the wishlist, you ensure that the updated data is immediately saved to local storage.

5. Add an event listener to the `window` object that listens for the `beforeunload` event. This event is triggered when the user is leaving the page. In the event listener, call the `persistWishlistToLocalStorage()` function to save the wishlist data. Here's an example code snippet:

   ```javascript
   window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
     persistWishlistToLocalStorage();
   });
   ```

   This ensures that the wishlist data is saved even if the user closes the browser or navigates to a different website.

6. Test your application by adding products to the wishlist, refreshing the page, and verifying that the wishlist functionality works correctly, retaining the previously added products.

7. Make further adjustments to the code and functionality as needed, based on your project's requirements.

## Adding Functionality to Mark Completed Activities

In this guide, we will add the functionality to mark activities as completed in the itinerary. This will allow users to track their progress and mark off completed activities within their itineraries.

### Step 1: Identify the DOM Elements for Activity Marking

1. Identify the HTML element or elements that represent each activity in the user interface.
2. Assign unique identifiers or class names to these elements to easily target them in JavaScript.

For example, if each activity is displayed as a `<li>` element with a class name of `activity`, and you have checkboxes or buttons for marking activities as completed within this `<li>` element, you can select them using JavaScript as follows:

```javascript
const activities = document.querySelectorAll('.activity');
const completeButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.complete-button');
```

### Step 2: Implement Activity Completion Functionality

1. Add event listeners to the complete buttons or checkboxes to capture user interactions.
2. Within the event listener, retrieve the activity ID or reference that needs to be marked as completed.
3. Update the activity object or data structure to reflect the completed status.
4. Update the user interface to visually indicate that the activity is completed.

Example:

```javascript
completeButtons.forEach((completeButton) => {
  completeButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    const activityId = event.target.dataset.activityId;
    const activityToComplete = findActivityById(activityId);

    // Update the activity object to mark it as completed
    activityToComplete.completed = true;

    // Update the user interface to indicate the completion status
    event.target.classList.add('completed');
  });
});
```

In the above code, we assume that the complete buttons have data attributes (`data-activity-id`) containing the unique identifier for each activity. The `findActivityById` function retrieves the corresponding activity object based on the provided ID. The `completed` property of the activity object is updated to `true` to mark it as completed. Additionally, the `completed` class is added to the button element to visually indicate completion.

### Step 3: Test the Functionality

1. Save your JavaScript file.
2. Interact with the user interface by clicking the complete buttons or checkboxes for various activities.
3. Verify that the activity completion functionality updates the activity status and visually reflects the completion in the user interface.

### Step 4: Styling and Formatting (Optional)

1. Apply appropriate CSS styles to the completed activities to visually distinguish them from the incomplete activities.
2. Customize the appearance of the complete buttons or checkboxes to match the overall design of your application.

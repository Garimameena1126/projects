In this task, we will create API endpoints to handle user registration and login. These endpoints will allow users to create an account by providing their information and authenticate themselves to obtain access tokens for protected routes. We will implement this functionality using a secure mechanism, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Let's get started!

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed and set up:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Express.js framework
- MongoDB (for data storage)

### Step 1: Set Up the Backend Server

First, let's set up the backend server using Express.js. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir backend
   cd backend
   ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

   This command creates a `package.json` file with default configurations.

3. Install Express.js as a dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

4. Create a new file named `server.js` (or any other name you prefer) in the project directory.

5. Open `server.js` in a text editor and require the necessary modules:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   ```

6. Create an instance of the Express application:

   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   ```

7. Set up a basic route to test if the server is working correctly:

   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Server is up and running!');
   });
   ```

8. Start the server and listen on a specified port (e.g., 3000):

   ```javascript
   const port = 3000;

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

9. Save the changes to `server.js`.

10. Test the server by running the following command in the project directory:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

    You should see a message indicating that the server is up and running.

Congratulations! You have set up the backend server using Express.js.

### Step 2: Set Up a Database Connection

Next, let's set up a connection to the MongoDB database. Follow these steps:

1. Install the MongoDB Node.js driver as a dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install mongodb
   ```

2. Open `server.js` in a text editor and require the `mongodb` module:

   ```javascript
   const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
   ```

3. Define a MongoDB connection URL and the name of the database you want to use:

   ```javascript
   const mongoURL = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
   const dbName = 'myapp';
   ```

   Modify the `mongoURL` and `dbName` variables to match your MongoDB configuration.

4. Add a connection function to connect to the MongoDB database:

   ```javascript
   async function connectToDatabase() {
     try {
       const client = new MongoClient(mongoURL);

       await client.connect();
       console.log('Connected to the database');

       const db = client.db(dbName);
       return db;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Failed to connect to the database', error);
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

5. Call the `connectToDatabase` function inside the server's `listen` callback:

   ```javascript
   app.listen(port, async () =>{
     console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
     const db = await connectToDatabase();
     // TODO: Use the database connection for further operations
   });
   ```

   This ensures that the server establishes a database connection when it starts.

Congratulations! You have set up a connection to the MongoDB database.

### Step 3: Create User Registration Endpoint

Now, let's create an API endpoint to handle user registration. This endpoint will receive user information in the request body and save it to the database. Follow these steps:

1. Open `server.js` in a text editor.

2. Add a route handler for the user registration endpoint:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const { username, email, password } = req.body;
       const db = await connectToDatabase();

       // TODO: Implement user registration logic

       res.status(201).json({ message: 'User registered successfully' });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error registering user', error);
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while registering the user' });
     }
   });
   ```

   The route handler uses the HTTP POST method and listens for requests to the `/register` endpoint.

3. Extract the user information from the request body. Make sure you have a JSON body parser middleware configured in your Express application to handle JSON data.

4. Use the `connectToDatabase` function to obtain a reference to the database.

5. Implement the user registration logic inside the try block. This logic should include the following steps:
   - Check if a user with the given email already exists in the database.
   - If the user exists, return an error response with an appropriate message.
   - If the user does not exist, insert the user information into the database.

   ```javascript
   // Check if a user with the given email already exists
   const existingUser = await db.collection('users').findOne({ email });

   if (existingUser) {
     return res.status(409).json({ error: 'User with this email already exists' });
   }

   // Insert the user information into the database
   await db.collection('users').insertOne({ username, email, password });
   ```

6. Send a successful response with a status code of 201 (Created) and a JSON object containing a success message.

7. Handle any errors that occur during the registration process and send an appropriate error response with a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error).

8. Save the changes to `server.js`.

Congratulations! You have created the user registration endpoint.

### Step 4: Create User Login Endpoint

Now, let's create an API endpoint to handle user login. This endpoint will receive the user's credentials in the request body and verify them against the stored user data in the database. If the credentials are valid, it will generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) and send it back to the client for future authentication. Follow these steps:

1. Open `server.js` in a text editor.

2. Add a route handler for the user login endpoint:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       const { email, password } = req.body;
       const db = await connectToDatabase();

       // TODO: Implement user login logic

       res.status(200).json({ token: 'generated-jwt-token' });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error logging in user', error);
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while logging in the user' });
     }
   });
   ```

   The route handler uses the

 HTTP POST method and listens for requests to the `/login` endpoint.

3. Extract the user's email and password from the request body.

4. Use the `connectToDatabase` function to obtain a reference to the database.

5. Implement the user login logic inside the try block. This logic should include the following steps:
   - Find a user with the given email in the database.
   - If no user is found, return an error response with an appropriate message.
   - If a user is found, compare the provided password with the stored password.
   - If the passwords match, generate a JWT and send it back to the client.

   ```javascript
   // Find a user with the given email in the database
   const user = await db.collection('users').findOne({ email });

   if (!user) {
     return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });
   }

   // Compare the provided password with the stored password
   if (user.password !== password) {
     return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });
   }

   // Generate a JWT and send it back to the client
   const token = 'generated-jwt-token';
   res.status(200).json({ token });
   ```

   Note: In a production environment, you would typically use a library like `bcrypt` to securely hash and compare passwords.

6. Send a successful response with a status code of 200 (OK) and a JSON object containing the generated JWT.

7. Handle any errors that occur during the login process and send an appropriate error response with a status code of 500 (Internal Server Error).

8. Save the changes to `server.js`.

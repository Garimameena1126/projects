# Step-by-Step Guide: Implementing User Authentication Using JWT

In this task, we will implement user authentication in our backend using a secure mechanism called JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Prerequisites

- Backend server set up using a web framework (e.g., Node.js with Express)

## Steps

1. **Install Required Packages**

   To implement user authentication using JWT, we need to install the necessary packages. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Then run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```shell
   npm install jsonwebtoken bcrypt
   ```

   This command installs the `jsonwebtoken` package for JWT implementation and the `bcrypt` package for hashing passwords securely.

2. **Create a Secret Key**

   JWT requires a secret key to sign and verify the tokens. In your backend code (e.g., `server.js`), create a secret key. It is recommended to store the secret key in a configuration file or environment variable for better security. For this guide, we will simply define the secret key as a constant.

   ```javascript
   const jwtSecretKey = 'your-secret-key';
   ```

   Replace `'your-secret-key'` with a strong and unique secret key of your choice.

3. **Implement User Registration**

   To allow users to register and create accounts, we need to implement a registration endpoint in our backend. This endpoint should validate the input data and securely store user credentials in a database.

   Here's an example of how to implement a user registration endpoint using Express:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
   const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

   const app = express();

   // Endpoint for user registration
   app.post('/register', (req, res) => {
     const { username, password } = req.body;

     // TODO: Validate input data (e.g., check if username and password are provided)

     // Hash the password
     const hashedPassword = bcrypt.hashSync(password, 10);

     // TODO: Store the username and hashed password in a database (e.g., MongoDB)

     // Return a success message
     res.json({ message: 'User registered successfully' });
   });
   ```

   In this code, we use the `/register` endpoint to handle user registration requests. We retrieve the `username` and `password` from the request body. Then, we validate the input data (you can customize the validation logic according to your requirements). Next, we hash the password securely using `bcrypt` with a salt of 10 rounds. Finally, we store the username and hashed password in a database (e.g., MongoDB) and respond with a success message.

4. **Implement User Login**

   To authenticate users and issue JWTs, we need to implement a login endpoint in our backend. This endpoint should verify the user's credentials and generate a JWT if the authentication is successful.

   Here's an example of how to implement a user login endpoint using Express:

   ```javascript
   // Endpoint for user login
   app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
     const { username, password } = req.body;

     // TODO: Validate input data (e.g., check if username and password are provided)

     // TODO: Retrieve the hashed password from the database based on the username

     // Compare the provided password with the hashed password
     const isPasswordValid = bcrypt.compareSync(password, hashedPasswordFromDatabase);

     if (isPasswordValid) {
       // Generate a JWT
       const token = jwt.sign({ username }, jwtSecretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });

       // Return the

 token to the client
       res.json({ token });
     } else {
       // Return an error message
       res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });
     }
   });
   ```

   In this code, we use the `/login` endpoint to handle user login requests. We retrieve the `username` and `password` from the request body. Then, we validate the input data (you can customize the validation logic according to your requirements). Next, we retrieve the hashed password from the database based on the provided username. We then compare the provided password with the hashed password using `bcrypt`. If the passwords match, we generate a JWT using `jsonwebtoken` and sign it with the secret key. The token is set to expire in 1 hour (`expiresIn: '1h'`). Finally, we send the generated token to the client as a response.

5. **Protect Routes with Authentication Middleware**

   To ensure that only authenticated users can access certain routes, we can create an authentication middleware. This middleware will check the validity of the JWT sent in the request header and allow or deny access based on the authentication status.

   Here's an example of how to create an authentication middleware using Express:

   ```javascript
   // Authentication middleware
   function authenticate(req, res, next) {
     const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];

     if (token) {
       try {
         const decoded = jwt.verify(token, jwtSecretKey);
         req.user = decoded;
         next();
       } catch (error) {
         res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
       }
     } else {
       res.status(401).json({ error: 'Missing token' });
     }
   }
   ```

   In this code, the `authenticate` middleware function checks for the presence of a JWT in the `Authorization` header of the request. If a token is found, it verifies the token using `jsonwebtoken` and the secret key. If the token is valid, the decoded user information is stored in the `req.user` object, and the middleware calls the `next()` function to pass control to the next middleware or route handler. If the token is invalid or missing, an error response with a 401 status code is sent to the client.

6. **Protect Routes with Authentication Middleware**

   Now that we have implemented user registration, user login, and authentication middleware, we can protect certain routes that require authentication. For example, we can protect an endpoint that allows users to create exercises.

   Here's an example of how to protect a route using the authentication middleware:

   ```javascript
   // Endpoint for creating an exercise (protected route)
   app.post('/exercises', authenticate, (req, res) => {
     // TODO: Handle creating an exercise for the authenticated user
   });
   ```

   In this code, we use the `authenticate` middleware as the second argument to the route handler. This ensures that the route is protected and only accessible to authenticated users. You can apply this authentication mechanism to other routes that require authentication as per your application's requirements.

7. **Test the Authentication**

   Start your backend server, and use tools like Postman or curl to test the user registration and login endpoints. Send requests to `/register` to create a new user account and `/login` to authenticate and receive a JWT. Verify that the registration and login processes work correctly and return the expected responses.

   To test the protected routes, include the JWT in the `Authorization` header of the requests. For example:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

   Replace `<token>` with the JWT obtained from the login process. Verify that the protected routes are only accessible when a valid JWT is provided.

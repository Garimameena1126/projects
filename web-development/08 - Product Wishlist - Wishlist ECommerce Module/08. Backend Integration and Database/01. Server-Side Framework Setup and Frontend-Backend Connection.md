1. Install Node.js:
   - Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).
   - Download the LTS version suitable for your operating system.
   - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

2. Create a new directory for your project:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
   - Create a new directory with the desired name for your project.
   - Change to the newly created project directory.

3. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```
     npm init -y
     ```
   - This will create a new `package.json` file that will keep track of your project's dependencies and configurations.

4. Install Express framework:
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
     ```
     npm install express
     ```
   - This will install the Express framework, which will serve as the foundation for your server-side application.

5. Create a new file named `server.js` in your project directory.
   - Open the `server.js` file in your preferred text editor.

6. Import the Express framework and create an instance of the application:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   ```

7. Define a route to serve the frontend files:
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.static('public'));
   ```

   In this example, the frontend files are assumed to be located in a directory named `public`. Adjust the directory name as per your project's structure.

8. Define a port for the server to listen on:
   ```javascript
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   ```

   In this example, the server will listen on port 3000. You can change it to any available port number.

9. Start the server and listen for incoming requests:
   ```javascript
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

10. Save the `server.js` file.

11. Create a new directory named `public` in your project directory.

12. Place your frontend files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) inside the `public` directory.

13. Start the server:
   - In your terminal, navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     node server.js
     ```

14. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified).
    - If your frontend files are set up correctly, you should see your website being served by the server.

## Summary

In this guide, you learned how to set up a server-side framework (e.g., Node.js with Express) and connect it to the frontend of your project. Here's a summary of the steps:

1. Install Node.js.
2. Create a new directory for your project.
3. Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init -y`.
4. Install Express framework using `npm install express`.
5. Create a `server.js` file in your project directory.
6. Import the Express framework and create an instance of the application.
7. Define a route to serve the frontend files.
8. Define a port for the server to listen on.
9. Start the server and listen for incoming requests.
10. Create a `public` directory and place your frontend files inside it.
11. Start the server using `node server.js`.
12. Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port) to see your website.

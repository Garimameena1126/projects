In this task, we will use JavaScript to dynamically generate the services section on the webpage. Follow the steps below to complete this task:

## Step 1: HTML Markup

1. Open your HTML file where you want to add the services section.
2. Identify the location where you want the services section to appear.
3. Create an empty container element (e.g., a `<div>` element) with a unique ID attribute to serve as the container for the dynamically generated content. For example:
    ```html
    <div id="services-container"></div>
    ```

## Step 2: JavaScript Code

1. Open your JavaScript file or create a new one.
2. Write a function that will be responsible for generating the services section and inserting it into the container element.
    ```javascript
    function generateServicesSection() {
      // Retrieve the container element
      const container = document.getElementById('services-container');
      
      // Clear the container
      container.innerHTML = '';
      
      // Iterate over the services data structure
      services.forEach(service => {
        // Create a new service element
        const serviceElement = document.createElement('div');
        
        // Set the class or other attributes for the service element
        serviceElement.className = 'service';
        
        // Create and append the content for the service element
        serviceElement.innerHTML = `
          <h3>${service.name}</h3>
          <p>${service.description}</p>
          <p>Price: ${service.price}</p>
          <p>Duration: ${service.duration}</p>
        `;
        
        // Append the service element to the container
        container.appendChild(serviceElement);
      });
    }
    ```
3. Customize the code as needed. You can modify the HTML markup inside the template literal to match the desired structure and styling of each service element.

## Step 3: Call the Function

1. Determine the appropriate time to call the `generateServicesSection` function. It can be called when the page loads or triggered by a specific event.
2. Add the following line of code to call the function at the appropriate time:
    ```javascript
    generateServicesSection();
    ```

## Step 4: Test and Iterate

1. Save your changes and open the webpage in a web browser.
2. Verify that the services section is dynamically generated based on the data structure.
3. If necessary, make adjustments to the code or the data structure and repeat the testing process until the desired outcome is achieved.

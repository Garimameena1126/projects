In this task, we will improve the user experience of our web interface by incorporating form validation for the email input field. Form validation ensures that the user enters valid data before submitting the form, preventing errors and improving the overall usability of the application.

To accomplish this, we will use HTML and JavaScript to perform client-side validation, which validates the input on the user's device before sending it to the server. Let's get started with the step-by-step guide:

1. **Add HTML Form Validation Attributes:**

   First, we need to add HTML form validation attributes to the email input field. These attributes will specify the rules for validation and display appropriate error messages. Modify the HTML code for the email input field as follows:

   ```html
   <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
   ```

   - The `type="email"` attribute ensures that the entered value is a valid email address.
   - The `required` attribute specifies that the field must be filled in before submitting the form.

2. **Display Custom Error Messages:**

   By default, the browser will display its own error message for the email input field. However, we can customize these error messages to provide more meaningful feedback to the user. Add the `title` attribute to the email input field and define custom error messages as follows:

   ```html
   <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required title="Please enter a valid email address">
   ```

   - The `title` attribute specifies the custom error message to be displayed when the input is invalid.

3. **Add Submit Button:**

   In order to demonstrate form validation, we need to include a submit button within the form. Add the following HTML code to include a submit button:

   ```html
   <input type="submit" value="Submit">
   ```

4. **Validate Form with JavaScript:**

   To enhance the user experience further, we can add JavaScript code to perform additional validation checks before submitting the form. Create a new JavaScript file, e.g., `validation.js`, and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   // Retrieve the form and email input element
   const form = document.querySelector('form');
   const emailInput = document.getElementById('email');

   // Add event listener for form submission
   form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
     // Check if email is valid using regular expression pattern
     const emailPattern = /^\S+@\S+\.\S+$/;
     if (!emailPattern.test(emailInput.value)) {
       // Prevent form submission
       event.preventDefault();
       // Display custom error message
       emailInput.setCustomValidity('Please enter a valid email address');
     }
   });
   ```

   - This code listens for the form's submit event and performs custom validation for the email input field.
   - The regular expression pattern `^\S+@\S+\.\S+$` checks if the email input matches the basic structure of an email address.
   - If the email is invalid, the `preventDefault()` method stops the form from being submitted, and `setCustomValidity()` method sets the custom error message for the email input field.

5. **Link JavaScript File to HTML:**

   Finally, we need to link the JavaScript file to the HTML document. Add the following code within the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   ```html
   <script src="validation.js"></script>
   ```

   - This code imports the JavaScript file and associates it with the HTML document.

That's it! You have successfully enhanced the user experience by incorporating form validation for the email input field. Now, when a user submits the form without entering a valid email address, they will see a custom error message indicating the issue.

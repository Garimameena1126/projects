# Creating API Endpoints for User Registration, Login, and Authentication

In this task, we will create API endpoints for user registration, login, and authentication in the workout tracking app. These endpoints will allow users to register, log in, and authenticate themselves in order to access the protected routes of the application. 

To accomplish this task, we will be using Node.js along with a web framework like Express.js. We will also utilize a database, such as MongoDB, to store user information securely.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step guide to create the API endpoints.

## Step 1: Design the API Endpoints

Before we start implementing the endpoints, it's essential to design the structure of the RESTful API. This design will determine the URL routes and HTTP methods used for user registration, login, and authentication. 

Here is an example of how the API endpoints can be designed:

| Endpoint               | HTTP Method | Description                  |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| `/api/register`        | POST        | User registration            |
| `/api/login`           | POST        | User login                   |
| `/api/authenticate`    | GET         | User authentication          |

## Step 2: Set Up the Express.js Server

To handle HTTP requests and create the API endpoints, we will use the Express.js framework. Follow these steps to set up the server:

1. Open your project directory in Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.

2. Create a new file called `server.js` in the root directory of your project.

3. Install the Express.js package by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

4. Open the `server.js` file and import the necessary modules:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   ```

5. Create an instance of the Express application and define the server's port:

   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000; // You can choose any available port
   ```

6. Start the server by listening to the specified port:

   ```javascript
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

   This will start the server and display a message in the console indicating the server is running.

## Step 3: Create the User Registration Endpoint

Now, let's create the endpoint for user registration. This endpoint will handle a `POST` request to `/api/register` and will be responsible for creating a new user in the system. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `server.js` file.

2. Add the following code to create the user registration endpoint:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/api/register', (req, res) => {
     // Handle user registration logic here
   });
   ```

3. Within the endpoint's callback function, you can access the request body using `req.body`. This will contain the user's registration information.

4. Implement the user registration logic, which may include steps such as validating the input, creating a new user in the database, and generating a unique user ID.

   Here's an example of how the registration logic could look:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/api/register', (req, res) => {
     const { name, email, password } = req.body;

     // Validate the input
     if (!name || !email || !password) {
       return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Please provide all required fields' });
     }

     // Create a new user in the database
     const newUser = {
       id: generateUniqueId(), // Generate a unique user ID
       name,
       email,
       password: encryptPassword(password), // Encrypt the password for security
     };

     // Save the new user to the database
     db.users.insert(newUser);

     return res.status(201).json({ message: 'User registered successfully' });
   });
   ```

   In this example, we validate the input fields, generate a unique user ID, encrypt the password, and then store the new user in the database.

5. Finally, send an appropriate response to the client. In this case, we're returning a JSON response with a success message or an error message if any validation fails.

## Step 4: Create the User Login Endpoint

Next, let's create the endpoint for user login. This endpoint will handle a `POST` request to `/api/login` and will be responsible for authenticating the user. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `server.js` file.

2. Add the following code to create the user login endpoint:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
     // Handle user login logic here
   });
   ```

3. Within the endpoint's callback function, access the request body using `req.body`. This will contain the user's login credentials.

4. Implement the user login logic, which may include steps such as validating the input, checking the credentials against the database, and generating a token for authentication.

   Here's an example of how the login logic could look:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
     const { email, password } = req.body;

     // Validate the input
     if (!email || !password) {
       return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Please provide all required fields' });
     }

     // Check if the user exists in the database
     const user = db.users.findOne({ email });

     if (!user) {
       return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });
     }

     // Verify the password
     if (user.password !== encryptPassword(password)) {
       return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });
     }

     // Generate a token for authentication
     const token = generateAuthToken(user.id);

     return res.status(200).json({ token });
   });
   ```

   In this example, we validate the input fields, check if the user exists in the database, verify the password, and generate a token for authentication.

5. Finally, send an appropriate response to the client. In this case, we're returning a JSON response with a token if the login is successful, or an error message if the credentials are invalid.

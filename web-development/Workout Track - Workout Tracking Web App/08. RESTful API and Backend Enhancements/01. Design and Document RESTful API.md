# Design and Document a RESTful API for the Workout Tracking App

In this task, we will design and document a RESTful API for the workout tracking app. A RESTful API allows clients to interact with the server using HTTP methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. Follow the steps below to design and document the API.

## Step 1: Define API Resources

The first step in designing a RESTful API is to define the resources that the API will expose. In the case of the workout tracking app, some possible resources could include exercises, users, goals, and workout logs. Let's focus on the exercises resource for this guide.

## Step 2: Determine API Endpoints

Once you have defined the resources, you need to determine the API endpoints that will be used to interact with those resources. Each endpoint represents a specific action on a resource. For the exercises resource, we can define the following endpoints:

- **GET /exercises**: Retrieve a list of all exercises.
- **POST /exercises**: Create a new exercise.
- **GET /exercises/{exerciseId}**: Retrieve a specific exercise by its ID.
- **PUT /exercises/{exerciseId}**: Update a specific exercise by its ID.
- **DELETE /exercises/{exerciseId}**: Delete a specific exercise by its ID.

## Step 3: Define Request and Response Structures

For each endpoint, you need to define the request and response structures. This includes specifying the data format (usually JSON) and the fields required for each request and response.

Let's take an example of the POST /exercises endpoint:

- Request Structure:
  - Method: POST
  - URL: /exercises
  - Headers:
    - Content-Type: application/json
  - Body:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Push-ups",
      "description": "Perform push-ups to strengthen your upper body.",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate"
    }
    ```

- Response Structure:
  - Status: 201 Created
  - Body:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "exerciseId",
      "name": "Push-ups",
      "description": "Perform push-ups to strengthen your upper body.",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate"
    }
    ```

Define the request and response structures for each endpoint based on the requirements of your workout tracking app.

## Step 4: Document the API

Proper documentation is essential for developers who will be consuming your API. It provides them with the necessary information to understand how to use the API correctly. You can use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to generate interactive API documentation, but for simplicity, we will create a markdown document to document our API.

Create a new file called `api-documentation.md` in your project's root directory and use the following template to document the API endpoints:

```markdown
# Workout Tracking App API Documentation

## Exercises

### Retrieve All Exercises

- **URL**: `/exercises`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Retrieve a list of all exercises.

### Create a New Exercise

- **URL**: `/exercises`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Create a new exercise.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Push-ups",
    "description": "Perform push-ups to strengthen your upper body.",
    "difficulty": "Intermediate"
  }
  ```
- **Response Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "exerciseId",
    "name": "Push-ups",
    "description": "Perform push-ups to strengthen your upper body.",
    "difficulty": "Intermediate"
  }
  ```

### Retrieve a Specific Exercise

- **URL**: `/exercises/{exerciseId}`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Retrieve a specific exercise by its ID.

### Update a Specific Exercise

- **URL**: `/exercises/{exerciseId}`
- **Method**: PUT
- **Description**: Update a specific exercise by its ID.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Push-ups",
    "description": "Perform push-ups to strengthen your upper body.",
    "difficulty": "Advanced"
  }
  ```

### Delete a Specific Exercise

- **URL**: `/exercises/{exerciseId}`
- **Method**: DELETE
- **Description**: Delete a specific exercise by its ID.
```

Replace the placeholder values with the actual URLs, methods, and descriptions based on your API design.

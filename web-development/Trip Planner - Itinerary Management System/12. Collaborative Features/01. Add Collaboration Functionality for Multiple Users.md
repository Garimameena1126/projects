# Adding Collaboration Functionality to an Itinerary

In this guide, we will learn how to add collaboration functionality to an itinerary in your application. This will allow multiple users to work on the same itinerary simultaneously, enabling real-time updates and communication. We'll assume that you have already set up the basic structure of the itinerary feature. Now, let's get started with adding collaboration functionality.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Backend server set up and running
- Frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) for building the user interface
- Real-time communication library (e.g., Socket.io) installed and configured

## Steps

### Step 1: Create a Collaboration Backend API
1. Implement a backend API endpoint that retrieves the itinerary details for a specific itinerary.
2. Create a separate API endpoint to update the itinerary based on user actions.
3. Ensure that the backend API handles concurrent updates from multiple users and resolves conflicts, if any.

### Step 2: Establish Real-Time Communication with Websockets
1. Set up the necessary backend infrastructure to handle websocket connections (e.g., using Socket.io library).
2. Create a websocket event listener on the backend to listen for itinerary update events.
3. Emit itinerary update events to connected clients whenever an update is made.

### Step 3: Integrate Websockets into the Frontend
1. Establish a websocket connection from the frontend to the backend server using the appropriate library (e.g., Socket.io client).
2. Create a component in your frontend code that displays the itinerary details and enables user interactions.
3. Implement event listeners on the frontend to listen for itinerary update events from the websocket connection.

### Step 4: Handle Collaborative Updates
1. Define the user actions that can trigger updates to the itinerary (e.g., adding a location, changing the itinerary date).
2. Capture these user actions in the frontend and send update requests to the backend API.
3. Update the itinerary details on the frontend based on the response from the backend API.

### Step 5: Update Itinerary in Real Time
1. When a user makes an update to the itinerary, emit an itinerary update event through the websocket connection to notify other connected users.
2. Implement event handlers on the frontend to receive and process itinerary update events.
3. Update the itinerary details on the frontend in real time to reflect the changes made by other users.

### Step 6: Resolve Conflicts
1. Implement conflict resolution logic on the backend to handle situations where multiple users make conflicting updates to the same itinerary.
2. Determine the appropriate strategy for resolving conflicts (e.g., last-writer-wins, manual resolution).
3. Communicate conflict resolution to the connected users through the websocket connection and update the itinerary accordingly.

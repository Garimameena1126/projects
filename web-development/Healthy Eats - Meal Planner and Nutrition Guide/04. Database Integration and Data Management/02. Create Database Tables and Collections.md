Before creating the database tables or collections, you need to choose a suitable database management system (DBMS) based on your project requirements. Some popular options are MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.

For the purpose of this guide, let's choose MongoDB as the DBMS.

### 2. Install and Set Up MongoDB
Follow these steps to install and set up MongoDB:

#### Step 1: Download MongoDB
- Visit the official MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
- Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific operating system.

#### Step 2: Start MongoDB Server
- Once the installation is complete, start the MongoDB server on your machine.
- Note down the hostname, port number, and other connection details required to connect to the MongoDB server.

### 3. Connect to MongoDB Server
To create database tables or collections, you need to establish a connection to the MongoDB server.

#### Step 1: Open MongoDB Shell
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Use the following command to open the MongoDB shell:
```shell
mongo
```

#### Step 2: Connect to MongoDB Server
- In the MongoDB shell, connect to the MongoDB server using the following command:
```shell
mongo --host hostname --port port
```
Replace `hostname` with the actual hostname and `port` with the port number of your MongoDB server.

### 4. Create Database and Collections
Now that you are connected to the MongoDB server, let's create the necessary database and collections to store user data and dietary information.

#### Step 1: Create Database
- To create a new database, use the following command in the MongoDB shell:
```shell
use myproject
```
Replace `myproject` with the desired name for your database.

#### Step 2: Create Collections
- Create the necessary collections (equivalent to tables in a relational database) to store different types of data. The collection structure will depend on your specific requirements.
- Here's an example of creating a collection to store user information:
```shell
db.createCollection("users")
```
This example creates a collection named `users`.

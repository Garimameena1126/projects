In this task, we will set up the necessary dependencies for our project. These dependencies include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript libraries that will provide the foundation for our web development project. Follow the steps below to initialize the project with the required dependencies:

## Step 1: Open the Project in Your Preferred Code Editor

Open your project in your preferred code editor. Make sure you have already completed the previous tasks of setting up the project repository and creating the basic folder structure.

## Step 2: Create the HTML File

1. Inside the `public` folder, create a new file called `index.html`.
2. Add the basic HTML structure to the file by typing the following code:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Software Development Solutions Company</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <!-- Content goes here -->
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
   This HTML structure includes the necessary tags for defining the document type, specifying the language, setting the character encoding, and creating the basic structure of the web page.

## Step 3: Include CSS Libraries

To style our web page, we will include CSS libraries. In this example, we will use Bootstrap as our CSS library.

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in your code editor.
2. Add the following code inside the `<head>` section to include Bootstrap CSS:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
   ```
   This code adds a link to the Bootstrap CSS file hosted on a content delivery network (CDN). It allows us to easily utilize the pre-defined styles provided by Bootstrap.

## Step 4: Include JavaScript Libraries

To enhance the functionality of our web page, we will include JavaScript libraries. In this example, we will include jQuery and Bootstrap JavaScript.

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in your code editor.
2. Add the following code just before the closing `</body>` tag to include jQuery and Bootstrap JavaScript:
   ```html
   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.0/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
   ```
   This code adds two script tags to include the jQuery and Bootstrap JavaScript files. jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, while Bootstrap JavaScript provides additional interactive features and components.

## Step 5: Verify the Dependencies

At this point, your `index.html` file should include the necessary dependencies. Your code should look similar to the following:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Software Development Solutions Company</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
   </head>
   <body>
       <!-- Content goes here -->
      
       <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js"></script>
       <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.5.0/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
   </body
   
   >
   </html>
   ```

## Step 6: Save and Commit Your Changes

Save the `index.html` file and commit your changes to the version control system. This ensures that your project is up to date and can be easily tracked.

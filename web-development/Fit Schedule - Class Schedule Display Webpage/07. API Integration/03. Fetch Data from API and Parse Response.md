#### Task: Modify the JavaScript code to fetch data from the API using the appropriate endpoints and parameters.

1. Start by identifying a suitable API that provides real-time class schedule data. Research and choose an API that meets your requirements. For example, let's assume you've chosen an API called "ClassScheduleAPI" that provides class schedule data.

2. If required, register for an API key by following the registration process outlined in the API's documentation. Obtain your API key as it will be needed to authenticate your requests.

3. Open the JavaScript file associated with your project. Let's assume the file is named "script.js".

4. At the beginning of the "script.js" file, declare a constant variable to store your API key. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key:

   ```javascript
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
   ```

5. Locate the section of your JavaScript code where you want to fetch the data from the API. In this case, you'll be fetching class schedule data.

6. To fetch data from the API, use the `fetch()` function provided by JavaScript. This function makes an HTTP request to the specified URL and returns a promise that resolves to the response. Replace `'API_ENDPOINT'` with the actual API endpoint provided by the ClassScheduleAPI:

   ```javascript
   fetch('API_ENDPOINT')
     .then(response => {
       // Handle the response
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Handle any errors
     });
   ```

7. Inside the `.then()` method, you can access the response data once the promise is resolved. Since different APIs may have different response formats, consult the API documentation to understand the structure of the response.

8. Assuming the ClassScheduleAPI responds with JSON data, you can parse the response using the `.json()` method:

   ```javascript
   fetch('API_ENDPOINT')
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(data => {
       // Process the data
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Handle any errors
     });
   ```

9. Within the second `.then()` method, you can now work with the parsed JSON data. For example, you might iterate over the class schedule data and dynamically populate your webpage with the relevant information.

10. Remember to handle any potential errors that may occur during the fetch request. In the `.catch()` method, you can define error handling logic. This could include displaying an error message to the user or logging the error for debugging purposes.

11. Save the changes made to the "script.js" file.

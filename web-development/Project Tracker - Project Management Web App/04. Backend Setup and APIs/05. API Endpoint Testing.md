## Task 5: Test the API endpoints using Postman

In this task, we will use Postman, a popular API testing tool, to test the API endpoints we have implemented in our Node.js server. Postman allows us to send HTTP requests and inspect the responses, making it an excellent tool for testing the functionality of our APIs. Let's get started!

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have the Node.js server running with the API endpoints implemented as mentioned in Task 2 and Task 3.
- Install Postman from the official website: [Postman Download](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

### Step 1: Launch Postman
1. Open the Postman application on your computer.
2. You should see the Postman workspace with options to create new requests and collections.

### Step 2: Create a new request
1. Click on the **"New"** button in the top left corner of the Postman interface.
2. Select the **"Request"** option.
3. In the dialog that appears, provide a suitable name for your request, such as "Get All Projects."
4. Choose the appropriate HTTP method for the request, e.g., **GET** for retrieving data.

### Step 3: Set the request URL
1. In the request URL field, enter the URL for the API endpoint you want to test.
   - For example, if you are testing the API endpoint to retrieve all projects, the URL might be `http://localhost:3000/api/projects`.
2. If required, include any query parameters in the URL to filter or sort the results.
   - For instance, you can append `?status=completed` to only fetch completed projects.

### Step 4: Add request headers (if necessary)
1. Click on the **"Headers"** tab below the request URL field.
2. If your API requires specific headers, such as authorization or content-type, add them here.
   - For example, you might need to include a header like `Content-Type: application/json` if you are sending JSON data.

### Step 5: Send the request
1. Click on the **"Send"** button located on the right side of the request pane.
2. Postman will send the request to the specified API endpoint and display the response.

### Step 6: Inspect the response
1. Once the response is received, you can view the details in the "Response" pane.
2. The response will include the HTTP status code, headers, and the body of the response.
3. Analyze the response to ensure it matches your expectations based on the API's functionality.

### Step 7: Test other API endpoints
1. Repeat the steps above to create requests for other API endpoints you have implemented.
2. Test different HTTP methods (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE) and different endpoints to cover all functionalities.
3. Pay attention to the request body and any required parameters for each endpoint.
4. Inspect the responses to ensure they align with the expected results.

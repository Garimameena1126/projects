## Creating Login and Registration Pages with Form Validation

In this task, you will create the login and registration pages for your meal planner application. These pages will allow users to create accounts, log in, and access their personalized information. Additionally, you will implement appropriate form validation to ensure that the user input is valid. Follow this step-by-step guide to create the login and registration pages with form validation.

### Step 1: Set Up HTML Structure

1. Create a new HTML file for the login page, e.g., `login.html`, and another HTML file for the registration page, e.g., `register.html`.

2. In both HTML files, start by setting up the basic HTML structure. Include the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

### Step 2: Add CSS Styling

1. Create a separate CSS file, e.g., `styles.css`, and link it to both HTML files using the `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` section.

2. Define CSS styles to format and style the login and registration forms. You can use CSS classes to target specific elements and apply appropriate styling.

### Step 3: Create the Login Form

1. In the `login.html` file, inside the `<body>` tag, create a `<form>` element to hold the login form.

2. Add appropriate `<input>` elements for the email and password fields. You can use the `type="email"` and `type="password"` attributes to specify the input types.

3. Include a submit button inside the form to allow users to submit their login credentials.

4. Add appropriate labels for each input field using the `<label>` tag. Associate each label with its corresponding input field using the `for` attribute.

5. Implement form validation by adding appropriate attributes to the input fields. For example, you can use the `required` attribute to make a field mandatory.

### Step 4: Create the Registration Form

1. In the `register.html` file, inside the `<body>` tag, create a `<form>` element to hold the registration form.

2. Add appropriate `<input>` elements for the email, password, and any additional fields you require for registration.

3. Include a submit button inside the form to allow users to submit their registration information.

4. Add appropriate labels for each input field using the `<label>` tag. Associate each label with its corresponding input field using the `for` attribute.

5. Implement form validation by adding appropriate attributes to the input fields. You can use attributes like `required`, `minlength`, `pattern`, etc., to enforce specific validation rules.

### Step 5: Implement Form Submission

1. In both HTML files, add an `action` attribute to the `<form>` element and set it to the appropriate URL where the form data will be submitted.

2. Implement the server-side logic to handle form submission and process the login or registration request. This will typically involve handling HTTP POST requests and validating the submitted data against your chosen authentication library or framework.

### Step 6: Style and Customize the Forms

1. Use the CSS file (`styles.css`) to style the forms and make them visually appealing. You can modify the layout, typography, colors, and other visual elements to match your application's design.

2. Apply appropriate CSS classes to style the form inputs, labels, buttons, and any other relevant elements.

### Step 7: Test the Forms

1. Open the login and registration HTML files in your web browser to test the forms.

2. Enter valid and invalid data in the fields to ensure that the form validation works as expected. Verify that the appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid input.

3. Submit the forms and verify that the data is being submitted correctly and processed on the server-side.

# Backend Server Setup

In this module, we will set up a backend server using a web framework of your choice (e.g., Flask, Django). We will create an API endpoint where users can submit customer support messages for sentiment analysis. The necessary logic to preprocess the user input and pass it to the trained model for sentiment prediction will be implemented. Finally, we will return the predicted sentiment label as the API response.

## Step 1: Choose a Web Framework

The first step is to choose a web framework to build our backend server. There are several options available, but for this guide, we will use Flask, a lightweight and beginner-friendly web framework for Python. Make sure you have Python installed on your system before proceeding.

### Installation

To install Flask, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install flask
```

Once the installation is complete, we can proceed to the next step.

## Step 2: Initialize the Flask Application

In this step, we will create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure.

### Create a New Project Directory

First, create a new directory for your project. You can choose any name for the directory. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired location. Then, run the following command to create the directory:

```bash
mkdir sentiment-analysis-api
cd sentiment-analysis-api
```

### Initialize a Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. In the project directory, run the following command to create and activate a new virtual environment:

**For macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

**For Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

### Create a Flask Application File

Inside the project directory, create a new file named `app.py`. This file will contain the main code for our Flask application.

Open `app.py` in a text editor and add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Save the file.

## Step 3: Define the API Endpoint

In this step, we will define the API endpoint where users can submit customer support messages for sentiment analysis.

### Import the Required Modules

Add the following lines of code at the top of the `app.py` file to import the necessary modules:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
```

### Define the API Endpoint

Below the existing code in `app.py`, add the following code to define the API endpoint:

```python
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict_sentiment():
    # Retrieve the user input from the request
    user_input = request.json.get('message')
    
    # Preprocess the user input (implement your preprocessing logic here)
    processed_input = preprocess(user_input)
    
    # Pass the preprocessed input to the trained model for sentiment prediction
    predicted_sentiment = predict(processed_input)
    
    # Return the predicted sentiment as the API response
    response = {'sentiment': predicted_sentiment}
    return jsonify(response)
```

In the above code, we defined a route `/predict` using the `@app.route()` decorator. The route is associated with the `predict_sentiment()` function, which handles the POST requests to this endpoint. Inside the function, we retrieve the user input from the request, preprocess it, pass it to the trained model for sentiment prediction, and return the predicted sentiment as the API response.

Note: The `preprocess()` and `predict()` functions mentioned in the code above are placeholders. You will need to implement your own preprocessing logic and sentiment prediction based on the model you trained.

## Step 4: Run the Flask Application

Now, we can run the Flask application and test the API endpoint.

### Run the Application

In your terminal or command prompt, make sure you are in the project directory where the `app.py` file is located. Then, run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see some output indicating that the Flask development server is running.

### Test the API Endpoint

To test the API endpoint, you can use a tool like cURL or Postman. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/predict` with a JSON payload containing the customer support message.

Here's an example using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "I need help with my order."}' http://localhost:5000/predict
```

You should receive a response with the predicted sentiment label.

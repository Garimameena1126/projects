## Step 1: Add Filter and Sort Controls to the Dashboard UI
1. Open the file that contains the analytics dashboard HTML code (e.g., `dashboard.html`) in your code editor.
2. Locate the section of the HTML code where you want to add the filter and sort controls. It could be a dedicated area or part of a navigation bar.
3. Add the necessary HTML elements for the filter and sort controls. For example:
   ```html
   <select id="filter-project-status">
     <option value="all">All Projects</option>
     <option value="in-progress">In Progress</option>
     <option value="completed">Completed</option>
   </select>
   
   <select id="sort-by">
     <option value="date">Date</option>
     <option value="priority">Priority</option>
     <option value="status">Status</option>
   </select>
   
   <button id="apply-filters">Apply Filters</button>
   ```

## Step 2: Capture Filter and Sort Events
1. Open the JavaScript file associated with the analytics dashboard (e.g., `dashboard.js`) in your code editor.
2. Find the section where you handle the initialization of the dashboard.
3. Attach event listeners to the filter and sort controls, capturing the user's selections. For example:
   ```javascript
   const filterProjectStatus = document.getElementById('filter-project-status');
   const sortBy = document.getElementById('sort-by');
   const applyFiltersButton = document.getElementById('apply-filters');
   
   applyFiltersButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
     const selectedProjectStatus = filterProjectStatus.value;
     const selectedSortBy = sortBy.value;
     
     // Call a function to update the dashboard based on the selected filters and sorting options
     updateDashboard(selectedProjectStatus, selectedSortBy);
   });
   ```

## Step 3: Implement Filtering and Sorting Logic
1. In the JavaScript file associated with the analytics dashboard, locate the function responsible for updating the dashboard (e.g., `updateDashboard()`).
2. Modify the function to accept the selected filters and sorting options as parameters.
3. Implement the logic to filter and sort the data displayed in the analytics dashboard based on the selected options. This may involve manipulating the DOM elements or fetching data from the server, depending on your specific implementation.
   - For filtering, you can use JavaScript array methods like `filter()` to narrow down the projects or tasks based on the selected status.
   - For sorting, you can use array methods like `sort()` to rearrange the data based on the selected criteria.
   - Update the displayed data accordingly.

## Step 4: Update the Dashboard Display
1. In the JavaScript file associated with the analytics dashboard, locate the section where you update the displayed data in the dashboard.
2. Modify the code to reflect the changes made in the filtering and sorting logic.
3. Use JavaScript DOM manipulation methods (e.g., `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, `innerHTML`) to update the relevant sections of the dashboard with the filtered and sorted data.
   - You may need to clear the existing data first before displaying the updated content.

## Step 5: Test the Filtering and Sorting Options
1. Open the analytics dashboard in a web browser.
2. Interact with the filter and sort controls that you added earlier.
3. Verify that the dashboard updates accordingly based on the selected options.
4. Test various combinations of filters and sorting to ensure the functionality is working as expected.
   - For example, select "Completed" from the project status filter and "Priority" from the sort by option to display completed projects sorted by priority.

To display the submitted form data, we need to fetch it from the database. Let's go through the steps to fetch the form data using a Node.js backend with MongoDB as the database.

1. Open the file where you have defined the route to handle displaying the form data (e.g., `server.js` or `app.js`).

2. Import the necessary modules at the top of the file.

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const Form = require('./models/form'); // Assuming you have a Form model
   ```

3. Create a new route to handle fetching the form data. For example, if you want to fetch the data when visiting the `/form-data` endpoint, add the following code:

   ```javascript
   app.get('/form-data', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       // Fetch the form data from the database
       const formData = await Form.find();

       // Send the form data as a response
       res.json(formData);
     } catch (error) {
       // Handle any errors that occur during the fetch
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while fetching the form data' });
     }
   });
   ```

   In this example, we use the `Form` model to fetch all the form data from the database using the `.find()` method. The fetched data is then sent as a JSON response using `res.json()`.

4. Save the changes to your backend server file.

5. Restart your backend server if it's already running.

6. In your frontend code, make an HTTP GET request to the `/form-data` endpoint to fetch the form data. You can use libraries like `axios` or `fetch` to make the request.

   ```javascript
   axios.get('/form-data')
     .then(response => {
       const formData = response.data;
       // Process the fetched form data
       // ...
     })
     .catch(error => {
       console.error('An error occurred while fetching the form data:', error);
     });
   ```

   Here, we use `axios.get()` to send a GET request to the `/form-data` endpoint. The fetched form data is available in the `response.data` property, which you can then process or display in your frontend application.

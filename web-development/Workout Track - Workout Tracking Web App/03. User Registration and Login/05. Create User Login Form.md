# Module 3: Implement User Registration and Login

## Task: Implement a User Login Form

In this task, we will focus on implementing a user login form that allows users to enter their email and password to authenticate themselves. We will handle the client-side form validation and set up a server-side endpoint to handle the login process. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create the HTML Login Form

The first step is to create an HTML form that will serve as the user login interface. Follow these steps to create the login form:

1. Open the `index.html` file located in the `public` folder of your project.

2. Inside the `<body>` tag, add the following code to create the login form:

   ```html
   <h2>Login</h2>
   <form id="loginForm">
       <div>
           <label for="email">Email:</label>
           <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
       </div>
       <div>
           <label for="password">Password:</label>
           <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
       </div>
       <div>
           <button type="submit">Login</button>
       </div>
   </form>
   ```

   This code creates a form with two input fields for email and password, and a submit button.

3. Save the `index.html` file.

## Step 2: Implement Client-Side Form Validation

To ensure that the user enters valid data in the login form, we need to implement client-side form validation. This will provide immediate feedback to the user if they enter invalid or missing information. Follow these steps to implement client-side form validation:

1. Open the `index.html` file located in the `public` folder of your project.

2. Add the following JavaScript code just before the closing `</body>` tag:

   ```html
   <script>
       const loginForm = document.getElementById('loginForm');

       loginForm.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
           event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission

           const emailInput = document.getElementById('email');
           const passwordInput = document.getElementById('password');

           const email = emailInput.value;
           const password = passwordInput.value;

           if (email === '') {
               alert('Please enter your email.');
               emailInput.focus();
               return;
           }

           if (password === '') {
               alert('Please enter your password.');
               passwordInput.focus();
               return;
           }

           // TODO: Perform login request to the server
       });
   </script>
   ```

   This code attaches an event listener to the form's `submit` event. It retrieves the values entered in the email and password fields and performs basic validation to check if they are empty. If any field is empty, an alert message is displayed, and the focus is set back to the empty field.

3. Save the `index.html` file.

## Step 3: Set Up Server-Side Endpoint for User Login

To handle the login process on the server side, we need to set up an endpoint that can receive the login request, validate the user's credentials, and send an appropriate response. Follow these steps to set up the server-side endpoint for user login:

1. Create a new file called `server.js` in the root directory of your project.

2. Open the `server.js` file and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

   // Middleware to parse the request body
   app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
   app.use(bodyParser.json());

   // Endpoint tohandle user login
   app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const { email, password } = req.body;

    // TODO: Implement user authentication logic

    // Example response for successful login
    if (email === 'user@example.com' && password === 'password') {
        res.json({ success: true, message: 'Login successful' });
    } else {
        res.json({ success: false, message: 'Invalid email or password' });
    }}); // Start the server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
   });
   ```
This code sets up an Express.js server and defines a `/login` endpoint that expects a `POST` request. The email and password entered by the user are extracted from the request body. In the provided example, a basic check is performed to validate the user's credentials. A JSON response is sent back indicating whether the login was successful or not.

3. Save the `server.js` file.

## Step 4: Test the User Login Functionality

Now that we have implemented the login form and the server-side endpoint, it's time to test the user login functionality. Follow these steps to test the login process:

1. Start your server by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   node server.js
   ```

   This will start the server and make it listen for incoming requests on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Fill in the login form with the following credentials:

   - Email: `user@example.com`
   - Password: `password`

4. Click the "Login" button.

5. The server will process the login request and send a JSON response indicating whether the login was successful or not. You should see a response similar to the following:

   ```json
   {
       "success": true,
       "message": "Login successful"
   }
   ```

### 1. Choose a Location
Choose a suitable location on your computer where you want to create the project folder. This location will serve as the parent directory for your project.

### 2. Open Terminal or Command Prompt
Open your preferred terminal or command prompt application. This will allow you to execute commands to create the project folder.

### 3. Navigate to the Parent Directory
Use the `cd` command to navigate to the parent directory where you want to create the project folder. For example, if you want to create the project folder on your desktop, you can use the following command:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```
Replace `~/Desktop` with the actual path to your desired parent directory.

### 4. Create the Project Folder
Once you are in the desired parent directory, use the `mkdir` command to create a new folder for your project. Choose a meaningful and descriptive name for your project folder. For example, if your project is named "MealPlanner", you can use the following command:
```bash
mkdir MealPlanner
```

### 5. Verify the Project Folder Creation
To verify that the project folder has been successfully created, you can use the `ls` command to list the contents of the parent directory. You should see the newly created project folder listed. For example:
```bash
ls
```
Output:
```
MealPlanner
```

# Module 2: Text Preprocessing and Feature Extraction

## Task: Preprocess the Text Data

In this task, we will preprocess the text data by removing unnecessary characters, converting text to lowercase, and removing stop words. These preprocessing steps are important to clean and prepare the text data before further analysis or modeling.

### Step 1: Import the Required Libraries

Before we begin, let's import the necessary libraries that we'll be using in this task:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
import string
```

### Step 2: Load and Inspect the Data

First, we need to load the text data that we will be preprocessing. Ensure that you have the dataset available or modify the code below to load your specific dataset.

```python
# Load the dataset
data = [...]  # Replace [...] with your dataset loading code

# Inspect the data
print(data[:5])  # Print the first 5 samples
```

Make sure to replace `[...]` with the code to load your dataset. The `data[:5]` line is optional and used here to display the first 5 samples for inspection.

### Step 3: Convert Text to Lowercase

Text preprocessing often involves converting all the text to lowercase. This step ensures that words with different cases are treated as the same and helps reduce the vocabulary size.

```python
# Convert text to lowercase
data_lower = [text.lower() for text in data]
```

The above code snippet uses a list comprehension to convert each text in the dataset to lowercase and stores the results in the `data_lower` list.

### Step 4: Remove Punctuation

Punctuation marks usually do not contribute much to the sentiment analysis task and can be safely removed. We will remove all punctuation marks using the `string.punctuation` module.

```python
# Remove punctuation
data_no_punct = [''.join(char for char in text if char not in string.punctuation) for text in data_lower]
```

In the above code, we iterate over each text in `data_lower` and use a list comprehension with `join` to remove all punctuation marks from each text.

### Step 5: Tokenize the Text

Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens. We will use the `word_tokenize()` function from the NLTK library to tokenize the preprocessed text.

```python
# Tokenize the text
tokenized_data = [word_tokenize(text) for text in data_no_punct]
```

The `word_tokenize()` function splits each text in `data_no_punct` into a list of words or tokens.

### Step 6: Remove Stop Words

Stop words are commonly occurring words that do not carry significant meaning and can be safely removed from the text. NLTK provides a list of stop words that we can utilize.

```python
# Remove stop words
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
data_no_stopwords = [[word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words] for tokens in tokenized_data]
```

The above code snippet creates a set of English stop words using `stopwords.words('english')`. Then, it iterates over each tokenized text in `tokenized_data` and removes any words that are present in the stop words set.

### Step 7: Finalize the Preprocessed Text

At this point, we have completed the text preprocessing steps. The preprocessed text can be further used for feature extraction and modeling tasks.

```python
# Join tokens back into text
preprocessed_data = [' '.join(tokens) for tokens in data_no_stopwords]
```

The above code snippet uses a list comprehension to join the tokens in `data

_no_stopwords` back into text format, separated by spaces. The resulting preprocessed texts are stored in the `preprocessed_data` list.

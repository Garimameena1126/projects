# Building a Backend API Endpoint to Fetch and Return Product Data

In this guide, we will build a backend API endpoint that will fetch and return the product data stored in the JSON file we created in the previous step. This API endpoint will be responsible for providing the product data to the frontend of our inventory management system.

## Step 1: Set Up the Backend Server

1. Open your preferred text editor.
2. Create a new file for your backend server code, such as `server.js`.
3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command in your project's root directory:
   ```shell
   npm init -y
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies, such as `express`, by running the following command:
   ```shell
   npm install express
   ```
5. In the `server.js` file, import the necessary modules and create an instance of the Express application:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   ```
6. Define the server's port number, for example:
   ```javascript
   const port = 3000;
   ```

## Step 2: Create the API Endpoint

1. Define a route for the API endpoint that will handle the request to fetch the product data. For example, to handle requests to `/api/products`, use the following code:
   ```javascript
   app.get('/api/products', (req, res) => {
     // Code to fetch and return the product data
   });
   ```

## Step 3: Read the Product Data from the JSON File

1. Import the `fs` module to read the JSON file:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   ```
2. Inside the API endpoint route handler, use the `fs` module to read the contents of the `products.json` file:
   ```javascript
   app.get('/api/products', (req, res) => {
     fs.readFile('products.json', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
       if (err) {
         console.error(err);
         return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
       }
       
       // Code to handle the retrieved product data
     });
   });
   ```

## Step 4: Return the Product Data as a JSON Response

1. Parse the retrieved data as JSON:
   ```javascript
   const products = JSON.parse(data);
   ```
2. Return the `products` array as a JSON response:
   ```javascript
   return res.json(products);
   ```

## Step 5: Start the Backend Server

1. Add the following code at the end of your `server.js` file to start the server and listen on the defined port:
   ```javascript
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

## Step 6: Test the API Endpoint

1. Save the `server.js` file.
2. Start the backend server by running the following command in your project's root directory:
   ```shell
   node server.js
   ```
3. Open a web browser or use an API testing tool like Postman.
4. Send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/products`.
5. If everything is set up correctly, you should receive a JSON response containing the product data.

# Beginner's Guide: Setting Up Project Structure with Appropriate Directories

In this guide, we will go through the process of setting up the project structure for your fitness class booking system web development project. We will create the necessary directories to organize your project files effectively. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to proceed.

## Step 1: Navigate to the Project Directory
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project folder you created earlier. For example, if your project folder is named `fitness-class-booking-system` and located on your desktop, use the following command:
```bash
cd Desktop/fitness-class-booking-system
```

## Step 2: Create the Project Structure
To create the appropriate directories for your project, follow the guidelines below:

1. **Create the `src` directory**: This directory will contain the source code files for your project.
```bash
mkdir src
```

2. **Create the `public` directory**: This directory will hold the static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, images) that will be served to the client.
```bash
mkdir public
```

3. **Create the `public/css` directory**: This directory will store your CSS files.
```bash
mkdir public/css
```

4. **Create the `public/images` directory**: This directory will store any images or media files used in your project.
```bash
mkdir public/images
```

5. **Create the `public/js` directory**: This directory will store your JavaScript files.
```bash
mkdir public/js
```

6. **Create the `views` directory**: This directory will contain the template files used to render dynamic content on the server.
```bash
mkdir views
```

## Step 3: Verify the Project Structure
After creating the directories, you should have the following structure in your project folder:

```
- fitness-class-booking-system
  - src
  - public
    - css
    - images
    - js
  - views
```

## Summary
In this guide, we created the project structure for your fitness class booking system web development project. Here's a summary of the steps we covered:
1. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command.
2. Create the necessary directories: `src`, `public`, `public/css`, `public/images`, `public/js`, and `views`.
3. Verify the project structure matches the specified directory hierarchy.

# Module 7: Implement Real-Time Updates and Notifications

## Task: Implement a Notification System

In this task, we will implement a notification system that will alert users of completed workouts or goal achievements in real-time. This will enhance the user experience by providing immediate feedback and engagement. We will utilize a real-time communication technology such as WebSockets to achieve this functionality. Follow the step-by-step guide below to implement the notification system.

## Step 1: Research and Select a Real-Time Communication Technology

Before implementing the notification system, it is important to research and select a suitable real-time communication technology. There are several options available, such as WebSockets, Pusher, Socket.IO, and more. For the purpose of this guide, we will use WebSockets as our real-time communication technology.

WebSockets provide a persistent connection between the client and the server, allowing real-time bidirectional communication. It is supported by most modern web browsers and can be implemented using various programming languages and frameworks.

## Step 2: Set Up Server-Side Event Listeners

To detect changes in the workout data and trigger notifications, we need to set up server-side event listeners. These listeners will monitor the workout data for completed workouts or goal achievements and emit real-time updates to the connected clients.

1. Identify the appropriate place in your server-side code to set up the event listeners. This will typically be in a file responsible for handling workout-related functionality.

2. Inside the event listener code, define the logic to detect completed workouts or goal achievements. This logic will depend on the specific requirements of your application. For example, you might check if a workout has been marked as completed or if a user has achieved a specific goal.

3. Once the conditions for a completed workout or goal achievement are met, emit a real-time update event to the connected clients. Include relevant information such as the user's name, the completed workout details, or the achieved goal.

Here's an example using JavaScript and Node.js with the `ws` library:

```javascript
// Import the required libraries
const WebSocket = require('ws');

// Create a new WebSocket server
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

// Set up event listener for new connections
wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  // Event listener for completed workouts or goal achievements
  // Implement your logic here

  // Emit a real-time update event to the connected client
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'notification', message: 'Congratulations! You have completed a workout.' }));
});
```

This example sets up a WebSocket server using the `ws` library and listens for new connections. Inside the connection event listener, you can implement your logic to detect completed workouts or goal achievements. When such an event occurs, a real-time update is sent to the connected client.

## Step 3: Implement Client-Side WebSocket Connection

Now that we have set up the server-side event listeners, we need to establish a WebSocket connection from the client-side to receive real-time updates.

1. Open the JavaScript file responsible for handling client-side functionality.

2. Create a WebSocket connection using the appropriate endpoint. The endpoint will depend on your server setup. In this example, we'll use `ws://localhost:8080` assuming the server is running on the local machine.

```javascript
// Create a new WebSocket connection
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
```

3. Set up event listeners to handle WebSocket events such as connection, message reception, and disconnection. For the notification system, we are primarily interested in receiving real-time updates.

```javascript
// Event listener for WebSocket connection
socket.addEventListener('open', () => {
  console.log('WebSocket connection established.');
});

//

 Event listener for WebSocket message reception
socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

  if (data.type === 'notification') {
    // Handle the received notification
    console.log('Received notification:', data.message);
  }
});

// Event listener for WebSocket disconnection
socket.addEventListener('close', () => {
  console.log('WebSocket connection closed.');
});
```

In this example, we listen for the `open` event to confirm the WebSocket connection, the `message` event to handle received notifications, and the `close` event to handle disconnections.

## Step 4: Display Notifications to the User

The final step is to display the received notifications to the user in an appropriate way. This could be through a popup, a toast notification, or any other user interface element that suits your application's design.

1. Identify the location in your HTML markup where the notifications will be displayed. This could be an empty `<div>` element with a specific ID.

```html
<div id="notification-container"></div>
```

2. Update the client-side JavaScript code to append the received notifications to the designated container element.

```javascript
// Inside the 'message' event listener
if (data.type === 'notification') {
  const notificationContainer = document.getElementById('notification-container');
  const notificationElement = document.createElement('div');
  notificationElement.textContent = data.message;
  notificationContainer.appendChild(notificationElement);
}
```

In this example, a new `<div>` element is created for each received notification, and its content is set to the notification message. The element is then appended to the designated container element.

## Step 5: Test the Real-Time Functionality

To ensure the notification system is working correctly, it is important to test the real-time functionality across multiple devices and browsers.

1. Start your web server and make sure the WebSocket server is running.

2. Open your web application on multiple devices or in multiple browser windows.

3. Perform actions that trigger completed workouts or goal achievements.

4. Verify that the notifications are displayed in real-time on all connected devices or browser windows.

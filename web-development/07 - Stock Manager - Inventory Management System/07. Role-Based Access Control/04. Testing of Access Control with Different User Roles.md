# Test Access Control Functionality with Different User Roles

In this guide, we will focus on testing the access control functionality with different user roles. The goal is to ensure that the role-based restrictions are working correctly and that users are granted or denied access based on their assigned roles. Let's proceed with the step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Set Up Test Environment

To begin testing the access control functionality, you need to set up a test environment that reflects different user roles. This involves creating user accounts with different roles and ensuring that each user has the necessary permissions assigned to their respective roles.

You can either create test user accounts directly in the database or use a user management system with an interface to manage roles and permissions.

## Step 2: Identify Access Control Points

Next, identify the specific access control points that need to be tested. These can be API endpoints or frontend features that should be restricted based on user roles.

Make a list of all the access control points that you have implemented, along with the expected behavior for each role.

## Step 3: Test Scenarios

Now, let's go through different scenarios to test the access control functionality for each user role.

### Scenario 1: Testing Restricted Access

1. Log in as a user with the `employee` role.
2. Attempt to access the restricted API endpoints or frontend features that are only accessible to `admin` users.
3. Verify that access is denied and an appropriate error message or response is received. For example, you can expect a 403 Forbidden response or a message stating "Access denied."

### Scenario 2: Testing Allowed Access

1. Log in as a user with the `admin` role.
2. Access the restricted API endpoints or frontend features that are accessible to `admin` users.
3. Verify that access is granted and the expected functionality is available. For example, you can create, update, or delete data.

### Scenario 3: Testing Multiple Roles

1. Log in as a user with a different role, such as `manager`.
2. Access the restricted API endpoints or frontend features associated with the `manager` role.
3. Verify that access is granted and the expected functionality is available for the `manager` role.

Repeat these scenarios for all the roles you have defined in your application.

## Step 4: Automated Testing (Optional)

To ensure ongoing correctness of the access control functionality, consider setting up automated tests. Automated tests can help catch any regressions in access control as you make changes to your codebase.

You can use testing frameworks such as Jest, Mocha, or Cypress to write automated tests for your access control functionality. Here's an example using Jest and supertest for testing API endpoints:

```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app'); // Your Express.js application

describe('Access Control', () => {
  test('Restricted endpoint should return 403 Forbidden for employee role', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/api/admin-only').set('Authorization', 'Bearer employeeToken');
    expect(response.status).toBe(403);
  });

  test('Allowed endpoint should return 200 OK for admin role', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/api/admin-only').set('Authorization', 'Bearer adminToken');
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  });
});
```

Adjust the code based on your chosen testing framework and application architecture.

# Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up Development Environment

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment for building a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with React framework. We will cover the installation of necessary tools and frameworks such as Visual Studio Code, Node.js, and create-react-app. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. Node.js: Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version suitable for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific OS.

2. Visual Studio Code: Go to the official Visual Studio Code website (https://code.visualstudio.com) and download the appropriate installer for your OS. Follow the installation instructions for your OS and complete the setup.

## Step 1: Installing Visual Studio Code

1. Download Visual Studio Code: Visit the official Visual Studio Code website (https://code.visualstudio.com) and download the installer suitable for your operating system.

2. Install Visual Studio Code: Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard prompts to install Visual Studio Code on your system. Choose the desired options during the installation process, such as adding it to the system path.

3. Verify Installation: Once the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to verify that Visual Studio Code is installed correctly:

```bash
code --version
```

If the command displays the version number of Visual Studio Code, it means the installation was successful.

## Step 2: Installing Node.js

1. Download Node.js: Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version suitable for your operating system. Choose the installer package based on your OS.

2. Install Node.js: Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard prompts to install Node.js on your system. Accept the default installation settings unless you have specific preferences.

3. Verify Installation: After the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command to check if Node.js is installed successfully:

```bash
node --version
```

If the command displays the version number of Node.js, it indicates a successful installation.

4. Verify npm Installation: npm (Node Package Manager) is installed automatically along with Node.js. To verify its installation, enter the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
npm --version
```

If the command shows the version number of npm, it means npm is installed correctly.

## Step 3: Creating a New React Project

1. Open Visual Studio Code: Launch Visual Studio Code by clicking on its icon in your applications or using the command `code` in the terminal or command prompt.

2. Open Terminal: In Visual Studio Code, open the integrated terminal by selecting "View" from the menu, then choosing "Terminal" or by using the shortcut `Ctrl + ` ` (backtick) on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + ` ` (backtick) on macOS.

3. Create a New React Project: In the terminal, navigate to the desired directory where you want to create your project. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example, to navigate to the desktop folder, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd Desktop
```

Once you are in the desired directory, create a new React project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Replace `my-app` with the name you want to give to your project. This command will create a new directory with the specified name and set up a basic React project structure inside it.



4. Navigate to the Project Directory: After the project is created, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd my-app
```

5. Start the Development Server: In the terminal, run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will compile your React code and start a local development server. The server will automatically open your web app in the default browser. You can view your app at `http://localhost:3000`.

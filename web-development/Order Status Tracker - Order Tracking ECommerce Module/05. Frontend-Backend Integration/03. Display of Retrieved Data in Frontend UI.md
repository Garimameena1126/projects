# Displaying Retrieved Data in the Frontend UI

In this task, we will focus on displaying the retrieved data from the backend in the frontend UI. Follow the steps below to incorporate the retrieved data into your frontend application.

## Step 1: Set Up the Frontend Environment

1. Ensure that the frontend project is set up and running. This includes having a working directory with the necessary files for your frontend framework or library (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the frontend project directory.

3. Install any required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

4. Start the frontend development server by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the frontend application and make it accessible at a specified URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Step 2: Retrieve Data from the Backend

1. Ensure that you have implemented API requests from the frontend to retrieve order details, as specified in the previous task.

2. Verify that you can successfully fetch the order details from the backend using the API requests. You can log the retrieved data in the console to ensure it is being received correctly.

   For example, if using React with `axios` for API requests, you might have a component method like the following:

   ```javascript
   componentDidMount() {
     axios
       .get('http://localhost:8000/api/orders')
       .then((response) => {
         const orders = response.data;
         console.log(orders); // Verify the retrieved data
         // Set the retrieved data in the component's state or props
       })
       .catch((error) => {
         // Handle errors
       });
   }
   ```

   Adjust the code based on your frontend framework, library, and the implementation of API requests.

## Step 3: Update the Frontend UI

1. Open the component or file in your frontend project where you want to display the retrieved order details (e.g., `OrderList.js`).

2. Import any necessary libraries or components to assist with rendering the data in the frontend UI. For example, if using React, import the required components or functions at the top of your file.

3. Utilize the retrieved order details to update the frontend UI and render the data accordingly.

   - If using React, update the JSX code in your component's `render` method to display the order details dynamically. Iterate over the retrieved data array and create the necessary elements or components to render each order detail.

     For example:

     ```javascript
     render() {
       const { orders } = this.state; // Assuming orders are stored in component state

       return (
         <div>
           {orders.map((order) => (
             <div key={order.id}>
               <p>Order ID: {order.id}</p>
               <p>Customer Name: {order.customerName}</p>
               {/* Render other order details */}
             </div>
           ))}
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

     Adjust the JSX code based on your specific UI requirements and the structure of your retrieved order details.

   - If using a different frontend framework or library, refer to the documentation for rendering data dynamically within the framework's syntax and best practices.

4. Save the file and ensure that the frontend development server is still running. Visit the frontend application in your web browser and verify that the retrieved order details are displayed correctly in the UI.

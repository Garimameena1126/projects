# Implement Add, Edit, and Delete Functionality for Classes

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of implementing the Add, Edit, and Delete functionality for classes in a fitness booking system. These functionalities will allow users to manage the fitness classes available for booking. We will provide detailed code examples along the way to help you understand and implement the features effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of web development concepts
- A working fitness booking system project set up
- Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A code editor of your choice

Let's get started!

## 1. Adding Classes

To implement the Add functionality for classes, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create an Add Class Form

In your HTML file, create a form that allows users to input the necessary information for adding a class. The form should include fields for the class name, description, schedule, duration, and any other relevant details. Here's an example:

```html
<form id="addClassForm">
  <label for="className">Class Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="className" required>

  <label for="classDescription">Description:</label>
  <textarea id="classDescription" required></textarea>

  <!-- Add other necessary fields here -->

  <button type="submit">Add Class</button>
</form>
```

### Step 2: Handle the Form Submission

In your JavaScript file, add an event listener to the form's submit event. When the form is submitted, retrieve the values entered by the user and create a new class object using those values. Here's an example:

```javascript
document.getElementById('addClassForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  // Retrieve form values
  const className = document.getElementById('className').value;
  const classDescription = document.getElementById('classDescription').value;

  // Create a new class object
  const newClass = {
    name: className,
    description: classDescription,
    // Add other properties as needed
  };

  // Perform necessary actions to add the class to your system
});
```

### Step 3: Perform Backend Operations

In the code snippet above, after creating the new class object, you need to perform the necessary backend operations to add the class to your fitness booking system. This might involve sending an HTTP request to your server, updating a database, or any other relevant operations specific to your system.

Make sure you handle the backend operations according to your project's architecture and requirements.

## 2. Editing Classes

To implement the Edit functionality for classes, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Retrieve Class Details

Create a mechanism in your system to retrieve the details of a specific class that the user wants to edit. This could be done through a form, a modal, or any other user interface element that allows the user to select a class.

### Step 2: Populate Edit Form

Once the user selects a class to edit, populate an edit form with the current details of the selected class. This will allow the user to see the existing information and make any necessary modifications. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Assuming you have retrieved the selected class details into a variable called "selectedClass"
document.getElementById('editClassForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  // Retrieve form values
  const editedClassName = document.getElementById('editedClassName').value;
  const editedClassDescription = document

.getElementById('editedClassDescription').value;

  // Update the selected class object with the edited values
  selectedClass.name = editedClassName;
  selectedClass.description = editedClassDescription;

  // Perform necessary actions to save the edited class
});
```

### Step 3: Perform Backend Operations

Similar to the Add functionality, you need to handle the necessary backend operations to save the edited class. This may involve updating the class details in your database or performing any other required operations.

## 3. Deleting Classes

To implement the Delete functionality for classes, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Confirm Deletion

Before deleting a class, ask the user to confirm their intention. You can achieve this by displaying a confirmation prompt or using a modal to get user confirmation.

### Step 2: Handle Deletion

If the user confirms the deletion, handle the necessary backend operations to delete the selected class from your system. This might involve sending an HTTP request, updating the database, or performing any other required operations.

Here's an example of how you can handle the deletion in JavaScript:

```javascript
function deleteClass(classId) {
  // Display a confirmation prompt or modal to get user confirmation

  // If user confirms deletion
  // Perform necessary backend operations to delete the class
}
```

Remember to adapt the code to fit your project's architecture and requirements.

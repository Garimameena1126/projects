# Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

In this module, we will focus on preprocessing the flight data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling. Preprocessing the data is an essential step before training a machine learning model as it helps in preparing the data for analysis and prediction.

## Step 1: Handling Missing Values

Missing values are common in datasets and can cause issues during analysis and modeling. In this step, we will handle missing values in the flight dataset.

1. Identify missing values: Start by identifying the columns with missing values in the dataset.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   
   # Load the flight dataset
   flight_data = pd.read_csv('flight_data.csv')
   
   # Check for missing values
   missing_values = flight_data.isnull().sum()
   print(missing_values)
   ```

2. Decide on the missing value handling strategy: There are several strategies to handle missing values, such as removing rows with missing values, filling missing values with a statistical measure (e.g., mean, median), or using advanced imputation techniques. Choose an appropriate strategy based on the nature and quantity of missing values.

   In this example, let's fill missing values in the 'price' column with the mean value.

   ```python
   # Fill missing values with mean
   mean_price = flight_data['price'].mean()
   flight_data['price'].fillna(mean_price, inplace=True)
   ```

   Note: The above code assumes the 'price' column contains missing values. Adjust the code based on your dataset.

## Step 2: Encoding Categorical Variables

Categorical variables are non-numeric variables that represent discrete values. To use them in machine learning models, we need to encode them into numerical form. In this step, we will encode categorical variables like airports and airlines.

1. Identify categorical variables: Determine which columns in the dataset contain categorical variables.

   ```python
   # Identify categorical variables
   categorical_vars = ['departure_airport', 'arrival_airport', 'airline']
   ```

2. Choose an encoding technique: There are multiple encoding techniques available, such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding. Select the appropriate encoding technique based on the nature of the categorical variables and the model requirements.

   Let's use one-hot encoding for the 'departure_airport' column as an example.

   ```python
   # Perform one-hot encoding
   one_hot_encoded = pd.get_dummies(flight_data['departure_airport'], prefix='departure')
   flight_data = pd.concat([flight_data, one_hot_encoded], axis=1)
   ```

   Repeat this step for other categorical variables as well.

## Step 3: Feature Scaling

Feature scaling ensures that all features have a similar scale or range, which can improve the performance of machine learning models, especially those based on distance calculations. In this step, we will perform feature scaling on the relevant columns.

1. Identify columns for feature scaling: Determine which numerical columns in the dataset require scaling.

   ```python
   # Identify columns for feature scaling
   numerical_vars = ['duration', 'distance']
   ```

2. Choose a scaling technique: Common scaling techniques include standardization and normalization. Select the appropriate scaling technique based on the distribution of the data and the requirements of the model.

   Let's use standardization as an example to scale the 'duration' column.

   ```python
   # Perform standardization
   mean_duration = flight_data['duration'].mean()
   std_duration = flight_data['duration'].std()
   flight_data['duration_scaled'] = (flight_data['duration'] - mean_duration) / std_duration
   ```

   Repeat this step for other numerical columns as well.

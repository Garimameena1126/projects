1. Open your project in your preferred code editor.

2. Create a new file named `products.js` in a directory named `routes` (or any suitable directory for your project's structure).

3. Import the required modules and set up the router:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();

   // Import any required models or data access modules here
   ```

4. Define the RESTful API endpoints for the products:
   ```javascript
   // GET /api/products
   router.get('/products', (req, res) => {
     // Handle logic to fetch all products from the database
     // Return the list of products as a response
   });

   // GET /api/products/:id
   router.get('/products/:id', (req, res) => {
     // Extract the product ID from the request parameters (req.params.id)
     // Handle logic to fetch the specific product from the database using the ID
     // Return the product as a response
   });

   // POST /api/products
   router.post('/products', (req, res) => {
     // Extract the product data from the request body (req.body)
     // Handle logic to create a new product in the database using the provided data
     // Return the created product as a response
   });

   // PUT /api/products/:id
   router.put('/products/:id', (req, res) => {
     // Extract the product ID from the request parameters (req.params.id)
     // Extract the updated product data from the request body (req.body)
     // Handle logic to update the specific product in the database using the ID and data
     // Return the updated product as a response
   });

   // DELETE /api/products/:id
   router.delete('/products/:id', (req, res) => {
     // Extract the product ID from the request parameters (req.params.id)
     // Handle logic to delete the specific product from the database using the ID
     // Return a success message or status as a response
   });
   ```

   Adjust the logic inside each endpoint according to your project's requirements and database operations.

5. Create a new file named `wishlists.js` in the same `routes` directory.

6. Import the required modules and set up the router:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();

   // Import any required models or data access modules here
   ```

7. Define the RESTful API endpoints for the wishlists:
   ```javascript
   // GET /api/wishlists
   router.get('/wishlists', (req, res) => {
     // Handle logic to fetch all wishlists from the database
     // Return the list of wishlists as a response
   });

   // GET /api/wishlists/:id
   router.get('/wishlists/:id', (req, res) => {
     // Extract the wishlist ID from the request parameters (req.params.id)
     // Handle logic to fetch the specific wishlist from the database using the ID
     // Return the wishlist as a response
   });

   // POST /api/wishlists
   router.post('/wishlists', (req, res) => {
     // Extract the wishlist data from the request body (req.body)
     // Handle logic to create a new wishlist in the database using the provided data
     // Return the created wishlist as a response
   });

   // PUT /api/wishlists/:id


   router.put('/wishlists/:id', (req, res) => {
     // Extract the wishlist ID from the request parameters (req.params.id)
     // Extract the updated wishlist data from the request body (req.body)
     // Handle logic to update the specific wishlist in the database using the ID and data
     // Return the updated wishlist as a response
   });

   // DELETE /api/wishlists/:id
   router.delete('/wishlists/:id', (req, res) => {
     // Extract the wishlist ID from the request parameters (req.params.id)
     // Handle logic to delete the specific wishlist from the database using the ID
     // Return a success message or status as a response
   });
   ```

   Customize the logic inside each wishlist endpoint based on your project's needs and database operations.

8. Export the router for both `products.js` and `wishlists.js`:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = router;
   ```

9. Open your main server file (e.g., `server.js`) and require the created route files:
   ```javascript
   const productsRouter = require('./routes/products');
   const wishlistsRouter = require('./routes/wishlists');
   ```

10. Use the routers in your server app:
   ```javascript
   app.use('/api', productsRouter);
   app.use('/api', wishlistsRouter);
   ```

   Adjust the base URL (`'/api'`) according to your project's API requirements.

11. Start the server and test the endpoints using tools like Postman or by making requests from your frontend application.

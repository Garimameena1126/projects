# Adding Search/Filter Functionality to Packages Page

In this guide, we will enhance the packages page of your travel agency website by adding a search/filter functionality. This will allow users to find specific packages based on their search queries. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Set Up the Search Input Field

1. Open the `packages.html` file in your code editor.

2. Locate the `<input>` element inside the `<section id="search">` section.

3. Add an `id` attribute to the `<input>` element, such as `search-input`, to make it easily targetable with JavaScript.

    ```html
    <section id="search">
      <input type="text" id="search-input" placeholder="Search packages...">
    </section>
    ```

## Step 2: Write JavaScript Code for Search/Filter Functionality

1. Create a new JavaScript file named `script.js` in your project folder.

2. Open the `script.js` file in your code editor.

3. Add the following JavaScript code to implement the search/filter functionality:

    ```javascript
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
      const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');
      const packageCards = document.getElementsByClassName('package-card');
    
      searchInput.addEventListener('input', function () {
        const query = searchInput.value.toLowerCase();
    
        for (const packageCard of packageCards) {
          const packageName = packageCard.querySelector('h2').textContent.toLowerCase();
          const packageDescription = packageCard.querySelector('p').textContent.toLowerCase();
          const isMatch = packageName.includes(query) || packageDescription.includes(query);
    
          packageCard.style.display = isMatch ? 'block' : 'none';
        }
      });
    });
    ```

The JavaScript code above performs the following steps:
- Listens for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the HTML content has loaded before executing the JavaScript code.
- Retrieves the search input element and package cards from the DOM.
- Adds an event listener to the search input, which triggers on user input.
- Retrieves the search query entered by the user.
- Iterates over each package card and compares the package name and description to the search query.
- Sets the display style of each package card based on whether it matches the search query.

## Step 3: Link the JavaScript File to the Packages Page

1. Open the `packages.html` file in your code editor.

2. Insert the following `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag to link the `script.js` file:

    ```html
    <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
    ```

Replace `"path/to/script.js"` with the actual path to your `script.js` file.

## Step 4: Test the Search/Filter Functionality

1. Save the changes made to the `packages.html` and `script.js` files.

2. Open the `packages.html` file in your web browser.

3. Type a search query into the search input field and observe the results. The package cards should dynamically filter based on the search query.

4. Try different search queries to see the filtering in action.

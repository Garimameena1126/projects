In this guide, we will implement the necessary changes to extend the coupon functionality in order to support different types of promotions, such as percentage-based discounts, free shipping, and buy-one-get-one (BOGO) offers.

### Step 1: Update Coupon Data Structure

1. Open the file where you store the coupon data or create a new file to define the coupon data structure.
2. Add new properties to the coupon object to support different types of promotions. For example, you could include properties like `discountType`, `discountValue`, `freeShipping`, `bogoOffer`, etc.

```javascript
// Example coupon data structure
const coupon = {
  code: "SUMMER20",
  discountType: "percentage",
  discountValue: 20,
  freeShipping: false,
  bogoOffer: false,
};
```

### Step 2: Implement Promotion Calculation Logic

1. Modify the existing code that calculates the discount amount to consider the promotion type.
2. Use conditional statements to check the `discountType` property of the coupon and apply the corresponding calculation logic.

```javascript
function calculateDiscountedAmount(coupon, totalAmount) {
  let discountedAmount = totalAmount;

  if (coupon.discountType === "percentage") {
    const discountPercentage = coupon.discountValue / 100;
    discountedAmount -= totalAmount * discountPercentage;
  } else if (coupon.discountType === "freeShipping") {
    // Apply free shipping logic
    // ...
  } else if (coupon.discountType === "bogoOffer") {
    // Apply BOGO offer logic
    // ...
  }

  return discountedAmount;
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Promotion-Specific Logic

1. For each type of promotion, you need to implement the specific logic to calculate the discount or apply the offer.
2. Add conditional statements or separate functions to handle each promotion type.

```javascript
function calculateDiscountedAmount(coupon, totalAmount) {
  let discountedAmount = totalAmount;

  if (coupon.discountType === "percentage") {
    const discountPercentage = coupon.discountValue / 100;
    discountedAmount -= totalAmount * discountPercentage;
  } else if (coupon.discountType === "freeShipping") {
    // Apply free shipping logic
    discountedAmount += coupon.freeShipping ? 0 : calculateShippingCost();
  } else if (coupon.discountType === "bogoOffer") {
    // Apply BOGO offer logic
    discountedAmount = applyBogoOffer(discountedAmount, coupon.bogoOffer);
  }

  return discountedAmount;
}
```

### Step 4: Implement Promotion-Specific Helper Functions (Optional)

1. If required, you can implement additional helper functions to handle specific promotion calculations.
2. These functions can be used within the main `calculateDiscountedAmount` function or separately, depending on your code structure.

```javascript
function calculateShippingCost() {
  // Calculate the shipping cost based on the user's location, package weight, etc.
  // ...
  return shippingCost;
}

function applyBogoOffer(totalAmount, bogoOffer) {
  // Apply the BOGO offer logic
  // ...
  return discountedAmount;
}
```

### Step 5: Update Coupon Application Logic

1. Modify the code that applies the coupon to use the updated `calculateDiscountedAmount` function.
2. Pass the coupon object and the cart's total amount to the function to calculate the discounted amount.

```javascript
function applyCouponToCart(coupon, totalAmount) {
  const discountedAmount = calculateDiscountedAmount(coupon,

 totalAmount);

  // Update the cart's total amount with the discounted amount
  // ...
}
```

# Beginner's Guide: Implementing a Booking System to Track Available Spots

In this guide, we will go through the process of implementing a booking system that tracks available spots for fitness classes in your fitness class booking system web application. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to accomplish this task.

## Step 1: Database Setup
1. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine. If not, download and install MongoDB from the official website (https://www.mongodb.com) and follow the installation instructions.
2. Create a new MongoDB database for your project. You can use a tool like MongoDB Compass or the MongoDB shell to create the database.

## Step 2: Database Schema Design
1. Determine the structure of your `fitnessClasses` collection in the MongoDB database. The schema should include the necessary fields to track the available spots for each fitness class. For example, you might have fields such as `name`, `instructor`, `schedule`, `capacity`, and `bookedSpots`.
2. Define the schema in your project using an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) or an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library. In this guide, we will use Mongoose, a popular ODM for MongoDB, to define and interact with the database schema.

   Example schema definition using Mongoose:

   ```javascript
   // Import the necessary dependencies
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

   // Define the fitness class schema
   const fitnessClassSchema = new Schema({
     name: { type: String, required: true },
     instructor: { type: String, required: true },
     schedule: { type: String, required: true },
     capacity: { type: Number, required: true },
     bookedSpots: { type: Number, default: 0 },
   });

   // Create a model based on the schema
   const FitnessClass = mongoose.model('FitnessClass', fitnessClassSchema);

   // Export the model for use in other parts of the application
   module.exports = FitnessClass;
   ```

## Step 3: Update the Class Booking Process
1. In your application's frontend, ensure that the user interface allows registered users to select and book fitness classes.
2. When a user submits a booking request, you need to update the available spots in the database accordingly. Perform the following steps to accomplish this:

   a. Retrieve the selected fitness class from the database using its unique identifier (e.g., `_id`).
   ```javascript
   // Assuming you have access to the fitness class ID from the frontend
   const fitnessClass = await FitnessClass.findById(fitnessClassId);
   ```

   b. Check if there are available spots for the fitness class by comparing the current `bookedSpots` count with the `capacity`.
   ```javascript
   if (fitnessClass.bookedSpots < fitnessClass.capacity) {
     // There are available spots
     // Increment the bookedSpots count by 1
     fitnessClass.bookedSpots++;
     // Save the updated fitness class in the database
     await fitnessClass.save();
     // Provide feedback to the user about the successful booking
     // For example, display a confirmation message on the frontend
   } else {
     // There are no available spots
     // Provide appropriate feedback to the user
     // For example, display an error message on the frontend
   }
   ```

3. Ensure that the booking process updates the `bookedSpots` count correctly and provides appropriate feedback to the user based on the availability of spots.

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a booking system that tracks available spots for fitness classes in your fitness class booking system web application. Users will now be able to book classes based on the availability of spots.

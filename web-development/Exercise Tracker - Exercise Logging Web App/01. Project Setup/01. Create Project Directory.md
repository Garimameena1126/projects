## Project Directory Setup

1. Open your preferred code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

2. Create a new folder for your project. Choose a meaningful name for the folder, such as "exercise-log" or any name of your choice.

3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the newly created project folder. You can use the `cd` command followed by the folder path to change your working directory. For example:

   ```shell
   cd /path/to/exercise-log
   ```

4. Initialize a new Git repository in the project folder. This will allow you to track changes and manage version control for your project. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   git init
   ```

   This will create a hidden `.git` folder within your project directory.

5. Now, let's create the basic project structure. We'll create separate folders for the frontend and backend components. Run the following commands one by one:

   ```shell
   mkdir frontend
   mkdir backend
   ```

   This will create two folders named "frontend" and "backend" inside your project directory.

6. Set up a basic HTML/CSS template for the frontend. Create a new file called `index.html` inside the "frontend" folder. Open the file in your code editor and add the following code:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Exercise Log</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to Exercise Log</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   This code sets up a basic HTML structure with a title and a heading.

7. Create a new file called `styles.css` inside the "frontend" folder. Open the file and add the following code:

   ```css
   /* styles.css */
   body {
       background-color: #f2f2f2;
       font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
       margin: 0;
       padding: 0;
   }
   
   h1 {
       text-align: center;
       margin-top: 50px;
   }
   ```

   This code sets some basic styling for the HTML content.

# Implementing Backend Queries for Attendance Statistics

In this guide, we will walk through the process of implementing backend queries to aggregate and calculate attendance statistics for the fitness classes in your fitness class booking system. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to accomplish this task.

## Step 1: Set Up Database Connection
1. Ensure that you have MongoDB installed and running on your system.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to your project directory.
4. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install mongodb mongoose
    ```
5. Create a new file called `db.js` in the project's root directory.
6. Open the `db.js` file and import the necessary modules:
    ```javascript
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    ```
7. Connect to your MongoDB database by adding the following code to the `db.js` file:
    ```javascript
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/fitness-class-booking', {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    })
    .then(() => console.log('Connected to MongoDB'))
    .catch((err) => console.error('Failed to connect to MongoDB', err));
    ```
   Replace `'mongodb://localhost/fitness-class-booking'` with the appropriate MongoDB connection string for your database.

## Step 2: Define the Attendance Schema
1. Create a new file called `attendance.js` in a `models` directory inside your project.
2. Open the `attendance.js` file and import the required modules:
    ```javascript
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    ```
3. Define the schema for the attendance collection by adding the following code to the `attendance.js` file:
    ```javascript
    const attendanceSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
      classId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Class' },
      memberId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Member' },
      attended: { type: Boolean, default: false },
    });
    
    const Attendance = mongoose.model('Attendance', attendanceSchema);
    
    module.exports = Attendance;
    ```
   Modify the schema according to your requirements and the structure of your existing data models.

## Step 3: Implement the Query for Attendance Statistics
1. Create a new file called `report.js` in the appropriate directory of your project.
2. Open the `report.js` file and import the necessary modules:
    ```javascript
    const Attendance = require('./models/attendance');
    ```
3. Implement the query to calculate attendance statistics by adding the following code to the `report.js` file:
    ```javascript
    async function calculateAttendanceStatistics() {
      try {
        const totalClasses = await Attendance.distinct('classId').countDocuments();
        const totalMembers = await Attendance.distinct('memberId').countDocuments();
        const totalAttendance = await Attendance.countDocuments({ attended: true });
    
        const attendancePercentage = (totalAttendance / (totalClasses * totalMembers)) * 100;
    
        console.log(`Total Classes: ${totalClasses}`);
        console.log(`Total Members: ${totalMembers}`);
        console.log(`Total Attendance: ${totalAttendance}`);
        console.log(`Attendance Percentage: ${attendancePercentage}%`);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Failed to calculate attendance statistics', err);
      } finally {
        mongoose.disconnect();
      }
    }
    
    calculateAttendanceStatistics();
    ```

## Step 4: Run the Query and View the Results
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the `report.js` file using the following command:
    ```bash
    node report.js
    ```
4. The attendance statistics, including the total number of classes, members, attendance count, and attendance percentage, will be displayed in the terminal.

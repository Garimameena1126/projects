1. Open the JavaScript file associated with your HTML file.

2. Locate the section of code where the product cards are generated or rendered.

3. Inside the loop that generates or renders the product cards, add logic to update the UI of each card based on whether it is already in the wishlist. Here's an example code snippet:

   ```javascript
   function renderProductCards(products) {
     const productCardsContainer = document.getElementById('product-cards-container');

     products.forEach((product) => {
       // Create a new product card element
       const productCard = document.createElement('div');
       productCard.classList.add('product-card');

       // Set other properties of the product card

       // Check if the product is already in the wishlist
       const isInWishlist = checkIfInWishlist(product.id);

       // Update the UI of the product card based on whether it is in the wishlist
       if (isInWishlist) {
         productCard.classList.add('in-wishlist');
       }

       // Append the product card to the container
       productCardsContainer.appendChild(productCard);
     });
   }
   ```

   In the code above, we assume that there is a function called `checkIfInWishlist()` that takes the product ID as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the product is already in the wishlist. Based on the result, we add the CSS class `in-wishlist` to the product card, which can be used to style it differently.

4. In your CSS file, define styles for the `in-wishlist` class to visually indicate that the product is already in the wishlist. For example:

   ```css
   .in-wishlist {
     border: 2px solid green;
   }
   ```

   In the code above, we set a green border for product cards that are already in the wishlist. You can customize the styles according to your project's design.

5. Save the JavaScript and CSS files.

6. Test your application by adding products to the wishlist and verifying that the UI of the product cards is updated accordingly.

# Predicting Email Spam or Not

In this guide, we will use the trained machine learning model to predict whether an input email is spam or not. We will create a basic web interface where users can input an email, preprocess the user input using the same cleaning and formatting techniques used during training, and then utilize the trained model to make the prediction. Finally, we will display the prediction result to the user.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have completed the following steps:
- Gathered a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails.
- Performed data cleaning and exploration as outlined in Module 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploration.
- Implemented a machine learning algorithm and trained the model as described in Module 2: Model Training and Evaluation.
- Saved the trained model for future use.

## Step 1: Setting up the Web Interface
1. Create a new HTML file named `index.html` to serve as the main page of our web interface.

2. Inside the `index.html` file, add the following basic structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Email Spam Classifier</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Email Spam Classifier</h1>
  <form>
    <label for="email">Enter an email:</label>
    <input type="text" id="email" name="email">
    <input type="submit" value="Predict">
  </form>
  <div id="result"></div>
</body>
</html>
```
In this HTML structure, we have created a simple form with an input field to enter an email and a submit button. The predicted result will be displayed in the `<div>` element with the `id="result"`.

## Step 2: Preprocessing User Input
1. Create a new JavaScript file named `script.js` and link it to the `index.html` file by adding the following code inside the `<head>` section of the HTML file:
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

2. Open the `script.js` file and define a function to handle form submission. Add the following code:
```javascript
function predictSpam(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission from refreshing the page
  
  // Retrieve the user input
  const emailInput = document.getElementById('email').value;
  
  // Perform preprocessing on the user input
  // Replace this placeholder code with the actual preprocessing techniques used during training
  
  // Make the prediction
  // Replace this placeholder code with the code to use the trained model for prediction
  
  // Display the prediction result
  // Replace this placeholder code with the code to show the result to the user
}
```

3. Modify the `<form>` element in the `index.html` file to call the `predictSpam` function when the form is submitted. Update the code as follows:
```html
<form onsubmit="predictSpam(event)">
```

## Step 3: Preprocess User Input
1. Inside the `predictSpam` function in `script.js`, perform the same cleaning and formatting techniques on the user input as done during training. This ensures that the input is processed consistently.

   For example, you can use the following code to convert the email text to lowercase and remove stop words:
```javascript
// Preprocess the user input
const cleanedInput = emailInput.toLowerCase(); // Convert to lowercase
const processedInput = removeStopWords(cleanedInput); // Remove stop words
```
Replace the `removeStopWords` function with the actual implementation you used during training for removing stop words.

2. You can also apply any other preprocessing steps you used during training, such as removing unnecessary characters, tokenizing

 the text, or stemming/lemmatizing the words.

## Step 4: Use the Trained Model for Prediction
1. Load the trained model in the `predictSpam` function to make the email classification prediction.

   Depending on the machine learning library or framework you used, the code to load the model may vary. Here's an example using scikit-learn in Python:
```javascript
// Load the trained model
const model = loadModel(); // Replace with the code to load your trained model
```

2. Use the loaded model to predict whether the input email is spam or not. Pass the preprocessed user input to the model's predict function.

   For example, if you trained a Naive Bayes classifier, the code might look like this:
```javascript
// Use the trained model for prediction
const prediction = model.predict([processedInput]);
```

## Step 5: Display the Prediction Result
1. Modify the `predictSpam` function in `script.js` to display the prediction result to the user.

   For example, you can update the function as follows:
```javascript
// Display the prediction result
const resultDiv = document.getElementById('result');
resultDiv.innerHTML = `Prediction: ${prediction}`; // Display the prediction result to the user
```

2. Save all the files and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Enter an email in the input field and click the "Predict" button.

4. The web page should display the prediction result, indicating whether the input email is classified as spam or not.

# Implementing a Search Feature to Find Exercises or Workout Routines

In this task, we will enhance the Workout Tracking App by implementing a search feature. This feature will allow users to search for specific exercises or workout routines. Follow the step-by-step guide below to implement the search functionality:

## Step 1: Create the Search Input Field

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in your code editor.

2. Inside the `<body>` element, add the following code to create a search input field:

```html
<input type="text" id="searchInput" placeholder="Search exercises or routines">
```

3. Save the changes made to the HTML file.

## Step 2: Implement the Search Functionality

1. Open the JavaScript file (`script.js`) associated with the HTML file.

2. Create a new function called `searchExercises()` to handle the search functionality:

```javascript
function searchExercises() {
  // Get the value entered in the search input field
  const searchValue = document.getElementById('searchInput').value;

  // Perform the search logic here
  // ...
}
```

3. Inside the `searchExercises()` function, you can write the logic to search for exercises or workout routines based on the entered search value.

   Example: Suppose you have an array of exercises stored in the `exercises` variable. You can implement a basic search functionality using the `filter()` method:

```javascript
function searchExercises() {
  const searchValue = document.getElementById('searchInput').value;

  // Filter the exercises array based on the search value
  const filteredExercises = exercises.filter(exercise =>
    exercise.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchValue.toLowerCase())
  );

  // Display the filtered exercises or update the UI accordingly
  // ...
}
```

4. Save the changes made to the JavaScript file.

## Step 3: Connect the Search Functionality to UI

1. Inside the `searchExercises()` function, after filtering the exercises, you can update the user interface to display the filtered results.

   Example: Suppose you have an HTML element with the id `exerciseList` to display the list of exercises. You can update its content with the filtered exercises using the following code:

```javascript
function searchExercises() {
  const searchValue = document.getElementById('searchInput').value;

  const filteredExercises = exercises.filter(exercise =>
    exercise.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchValue.toLowerCase())
  );

  // Get the exercise list element
  const exerciseListElement = document.getElementById('exerciseList');

  // Clear the previous list of exercises
  exerciseListElement.innerHTML = '';

  // Display the filtered exercises
  filteredExercises.forEach(exercise => {
    const exerciseItem = document.createElement('li');
    exerciseItem.textContent = exercise.name;
    exerciseListElement.appendChild(exerciseItem);
  });
}
```

2. Save the changes made to the JavaScript file.

## Step 4: Test the Search Functionality

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.

2. Enter a search term in the search input field and press Enter or trigger the search event.

3. Verify that the exercises or workout routines matching the search term are displayed or updated accordingly.

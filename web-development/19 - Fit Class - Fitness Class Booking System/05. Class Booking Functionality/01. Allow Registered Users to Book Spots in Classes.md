# Beginner's Guide: Allowing Registered Users to Book Spots in Fitness Classes

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of implementing the functionality to allow registered users to book spots in fitness classes for your fitness class booking system web application. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to accomplish this task.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have completed the following tasks:
- Module 3: Implementing User Authentication
  - Set up a user registration form with validation.
  - Create a login form for existing members to access their accounts.
  - Implement authentication functionality using passport.js or a similar library.
  - Store user information in a MongoDB database.

## Step 1: Design the Booking Interface
1. Create a new file called `book.html` in the appropriate directory of your project (e.g., `public/book.html`).
2. Open the `book.html` file in your preferred text editor.
3. Add the necessary HTML code to create a booking form. The form should include input fields for the user to select the desired fitness class, date, time, and any other relevant information.
4. Ensure that the form is only accessible to authenticated users. You can achieve this by implementing appropriate access controls or by redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.

Example HTML code for the booking form:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Book Fitness Class</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Book a Fitness Class</h1>
  <form action="/book" method="POST">
    <label for="class">Select a Class:</label>
    <select name="class" id="class">
      <option value="yoga">Yoga</option>
      <option value="zumba">Zumba</option>
      <option value="pilates">Pilates</option>
    </select>

    <!-- Add more fields for date, time, etc. as needed -->

    <button type="submit">Book Class</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 2: Implement the Booking Route
1. Open the file where you define your application routes (e.g., `src/routes/index.js`).
2. Import any required dependencies, such as your database model and authentication middleware.
3. Add a new route for handling class bookings. This route should listen for a POST request to `/book`.
4. Implement the necessary code to handle the booking request. This code should validate the input, update the class availability, and associate the booking with the user.

Example route implementation using Express.js:
```javascript
// Import dependencies and models
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Class = require('../models/class');

// Define the route for class bookings
router.post('/book', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Extract the booking details from the request body
    const { classId, date, time } = req.body;

    // Validate the input

    // Check class availability and update the booking

    // Associate the booking with the user

    // Send a confirmation response
    res.send('Booking successful!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('An error occurred while processing your booking.');
  }
});

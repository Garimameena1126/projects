## Setting Up a New Project Folder

In this guide, we will walk through the steps to set up a new project folder. This is an essential first step in starting a web development project. We will also create the basic file structure and set up the necessary libraries and dependencies.

### Step 1: Create a Project Folder

1. Open your preferred file explorer or command line interface.
2. Navigate to the location where you want to create your project folder.
3. Right-click in the desired location and select "New Folder" or use the command `mkdir project-name` in the command line, replacing `project-name` with the desired name for your project.

### Step 2: Initialize a Git Repository

1. Open your command line interface and navigate to the project folder you created in the previous step.
2. Run the following command to initialize a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   This command initializes an empty Git repository in the current directory.

### Step 3: Create the Basic File Structure

1. Inside your project folder, create the following files:
   - `index.html`: This file will serve as the entry point for your web application.
   - `styles.css`: This file will contain the CSS styles for your application.
   - `app.js`: This file will hold the JavaScript code for your application.

   You can create these files using a text editor or through the command line interface using the `touch` command. For example:
   ```bash
   touch index.html styles.css app.js
   ```

### Step 4: Set Up Necessary Libraries and Dependencies

1. Download and include the necessary libraries and dependencies in your project. For this guide, we will set up jQuery and Bootstrap.
   - **jQuery**:
     - Visit the [jQuery website](https://jquery.com/) and download the latest version of jQuery.
     - Copy the downloaded jQuery file (usually named `jquery.min.js`) into your project folder.
     - In your `index.html` file, add the following code inside the `<head>` tag to include jQuery:
       ```html
       <script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
       ```
   - **Bootstrap**:
     - Visit the [Bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/) and download the latest version of Bootstrap.
     - Extract the downloaded Bootstrap files.
     - Copy the following files from the Bootstrap package into your project folder:
       - `bootstrap.min.css` (located in the `css` folder)
       - `bootstrap.min.js` (located in the `js` folder)
     - In your `index.html` file, add the following code inside the `<head>` tag to include Bootstrap's CSS:
       ```html
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.min.css">
       ```
     - Add the following code just before the closing `</body>` tag to include Bootstrap's JavaScript:
       ```html
       <script src="bootstrap.min.js"></script>
       ```

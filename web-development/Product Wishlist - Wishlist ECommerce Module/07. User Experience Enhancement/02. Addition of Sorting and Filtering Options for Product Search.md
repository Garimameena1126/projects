
## Adding Sorting and Filtering Options

1. Open the JavaScript file associated with your project.

2. Define an array called `products` that contains all the products in your catalog. Each product should have properties like `name`, `price`, and `category` that can be used for sorting and filtering.

   ```javascript
   const products = [
     { name: 'Product 1', price: 10, category: 'Category A' },
     { name: 'Product 2', price: 20, category: 'Category B' },
     // Add more products
   ];
   ```

   Customize the array according to your specific product data.

3. Create a function to render the products on the page.

   ```javascript
   function renderProducts(products) {
     const productContainer = document.querySelector('.product-container');
     productContainer.innerHTML = '';

     products.forEach((product) => {
       const productElement = document.createElement('div');
       // Set up the product element with relevant information
       productContainer.appendChild(productElement);
     });
   }
   ```

   The `renderProducts` function takes an array of products as input and renders them on the page. In this example, we assume that you have a product container with a class name `.product-container` where the products will be displayed.

4. Implement sorting functionality by adding a select element and event listener for sorting options.

   ```javascript
   const sortSelect = document.querySelector('.sort-select');
   sortSelect.addEventListener('change', () => {
     const sortBy = sortSelect.value;

     // Sort the products based on the selected sorting option
     if (sortBy === 'name') {
       products.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));
     } else if (sortBy === 'price') {
       products.sort((a, b) => a.price - b.price);
     }

     renderProducts(products);
   });
   ```

   In the code above, we assume that you have a select element for sorting with a class name `.sort-select`. When the value of the select element changes, the event listener triggers. Depending on the selected sorting option (e.g., by name or price), the `products` array is sorted accordingly. After sorting, the `renderProducts` function is called to update the displayed products.

5. Implement filtering functionality by adding checkboxes for filtering options.

   ```javascript
   const filterCheckboxes = document.querySelectorAll('.filter-checkbox');
   filterCheckboxes.forEach((checkbox) => {
     checkbox.addEventListener('change', () => {
       const filteredProducts = products.filter((product) => {
         const category = checkbox.value;
         return product.category === category;
       });

       renderProducts(filteredProducts);
     });
   });
   ```

   In the code above, we assume that you have checkboxes for filtering options with a class name `.filter-checkbox`. Each checkbox corresponds to a specific category. When a checkbox is checked or unchecked, its associated event listener triggers. The `filteredProducts` array is created by filtering the `products` array based on the selected category. The `renderProducts` function is then called to update the displayed products.

6. Test your application by trying out different sorting and filtering options and verifying that the products are sorted and filtered correctly.

7. Make further adjustments to the code and functionality as needed based on your project's requirements.

## Summary

In this guide, you learned how to add sorting and filtering options to allow users to find products easily. Here's a summary of the steps:

1. Define an array of products with relevant properties.
2. Create a function to render the products on the page.
3. Implement sorting functionality using a select element and an event listener.
4. Implement filtering functionality using checkboxes and event listeners.
5. Test and refine the functionality as needed.

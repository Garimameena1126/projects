Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. npm, which stands for Node Package Manager, is a package manager for Node.js packages.

Follow the steps below to install Node.js and npm on your machine:

1. **Download Node.js and npm**: Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Node.js, which includes npm. LTS versions are recommended for most users.

2. **Run the installer**: Once the download is complete, run the installer program and follow the installation wizard's instructions. The installation steps may vary slightly depending on your operating system.

3. **Verify the installation**: After the installation is complete, you can verify that Node.js and npm are correctly installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing the following commands:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

   This command will display the version of Node.js installed on your machine. It should output something like `v14.17.0`.

   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```

   This command will display the version of npm installed on your machine. It should output something like `6.14.13`.

   If both commands display the version numbers without any errors, it means that Node.js and npm are successfully installed.

4. **Create a new project directory**: Now, let's create a new directory for your project. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the location where you want to create the project directory. Use the following command to create a new directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir project-directory
   ```

   Replace `project-directory` with the desired name for your project directory.

5. **Initialize a new Node.js project**: Change into the newly created project directory using the following command:

   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   ```

   Once you're inside the project directory, initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm init
   ```

   This command will start an interactive process where you'll be prompted to provide information about your project (e.g., package name, version, description). You can press Enter to accept the default values or provide your own.

   At the end of the process, it will generate a `package.json` file in your project directory, which includes metadata about your project and its dependencies.

6. **Install necessary dependencies**: In this step, we'll install the required dependencies for your project, such as Express.js, MongoDB, and any other libraries or frameworks you plan to use. To install a package, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install package-name
   ```

   Replace `package-name` with the name of the package you want to install. For example, to install Express.js, you would run:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

   Repeat this command for each package you want to install. npm will automatically fetch and install the specified packages from the npm registry.

   Additionally, you can use the `--save` flag to save the installed packages as dependencies in your `package.json` file. This allows you to easily manage and reproduce the project's dependencies in the future.

   ```bash
   npm install package-name --save
   ```

   Replace `package-name` with the desired package name.

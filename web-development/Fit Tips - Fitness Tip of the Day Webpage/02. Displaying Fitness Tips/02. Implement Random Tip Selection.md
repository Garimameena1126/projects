## Implementing a Function to Randomly Select a Fitness Tip

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of implementing a JavaScript function that randomly selects a fitness tip from a collection. This function will be used to display a random tip on the website's content section. Let's get started!

### Step 1: Define the Fitness Tips Collection

1. Open the `script.js` file in a text editor.

   ```bash
   code script.js
   ```

2. Define an array or data structure to store a collection of fitness tips. Each tip can be represented as a string.

   ```javascript
   // script.js

   const fitnessTips = [
       "Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.",
       "Incorporate strength training exercises into your routine.",
       "Get at least 8 hours of sleep every night.",
       "Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables.",
       // Add more fitness tips to the collection
   ];
   ```

   Here, we have created an array called `fitnessTips` that contains several fitness tips. You can add as many tips as you like to the collection.

### Step 2: Implement the Random Tip Selection Function

1. Create a function called `getRandomTip()` that will select a random tip from the `fitnessTips` collection.

   ```javascript
   // script.js

   function getRandomTip() {
       const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * fitnessTips.length);
       return fitnessTips[randomIndex];
   }
   ```

   In this function, we generate a random index between 0 and the length of the `fitnessTips` array using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()`. We then use this index to retrieve a random fitness tip from the array.

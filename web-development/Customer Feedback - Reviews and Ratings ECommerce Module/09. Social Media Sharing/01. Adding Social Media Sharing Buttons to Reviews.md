# Beginner's Guide: Adding Social Media Sharing Buttons to Reviews

In this guide, we will learn how to add social media sharing buttons to each review in order to provide users with the ability to share reviews on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. We will follow a step-by-step approach to implement this feature.

## Step 1: Design the Social Media Sharing Buttons
Before we can add the social media sharing buttons to the reviews, we need to design the buttons that will be displayed alongside each review.

1. Determine which social media platforms you want to support for sharing. For example, Facebook and Twitter are commonly used platforms for sharing content.

2. Design the UI for the sharing buttons. Consider the visual appearance, such as the icons representing each platform and any additional styling or interactive elements.

3. Decide on the placement of the sharing buttons within the review component. This could be within the review card, next to the review text, or in a separate section dedicated to sharing.

4. Identify the information that needs to be shared along with the review, such as the review text, product details, and any associated images or links.

## Step 2: Implement Social Media Sharing APIs
To enable users to share reviews on social media platforms, we need to integrate the respective social media sharing APIs into our application.

1. Register and obtain API credentials for each social media platform you plan to support. Refer to the documentation of each platform to understand the registration process and obtain the necessary credentials, such as API keys.

2. Integrate the social media platform SDKs or libraries into your frontend codebase. These SDKs will provide the necessary methods and functionality to interact with the social media sharing APIs.

3. Implement the logic to trigger the sharing action when a user clicks on a sharing button. This typically involves calling the appropriate API method with the content to be shared, such as the review text and relevant information.

4. Customize the shared content according to the platform's API specifications. Each platform may have specific requirements for the content format, including metadata, images, or links.

## Step 3: Add Sharing Buttons to Reviews
Now that we have designed the sharing buttons and integrated the social media sharing APIs, we can add the buttons to each review in the frontend.

1. Identify the location in your frontend codebase where the reviews are rendered. This could be a specific section of a webpage or a dedicated reviews component.

2. Modify the review component to include the social media sharing buttons alongside each review. This could involve adding HTML elements and CSS classes to represent the buttons.

3. Attach event listeners to the sharing buttons to handle the sharing action. When a user clicks on a button, the associated sharing logic should be triggered to share the review on the corresponding social media platform.

Here's an example of how you can add Facebook and Twitter sharing buttons to a review using HTML and JavaScript:

```html
<div class="review">
  <p>Review text goes here...</p>
  <div class="social-buttons">
    <button class="share-facebook">Share on Facebook</button>
    <button class="share-twitter">Share on Twitter</button>
  </div>
</div>

<script>
  // Assuming you have integrated the Facebook and Twitter SDKs

  // Attach event listeners to the sharing buttons
  const facebookButton = document.querySelector('.share-facebook');
  const twitterButton = document.querySelector('.share-twitter');

  facebookButton.addEventListener('click', shareOnFacebook);
  twitterButton.addEventListener('click', shareOnTwitter);

  // Sharing logic for Facebook
  function shareOnFacebook() {
    // Prepare the content to be shared
    const reviewText = "Review text goes here...";
    const shareUrl = "https://example.com/review/123";

    // Use the Facebook SDK

 to trigger the sharing action
    FB.ui({
      method: 'share',
      href: shareUrl,
      quote: reviewText
    });
  }

  // Sharing logic for Twitter
  function shareOnTwitter() {
    // Prepare the content to be shared
    const reviewText = "Review text goes here...";
    const shareUrl = "https://example.com/review/123";

    // Use the Twitter SDK to trigger the sharing action
    twttr.ready(() => {
      twttr.widgets.createShareButton(
        shareUrl,
        document.querySelector('.share-twitter'),
        {
          text: reviewText
        }
      );
    });
  }
</script>
```

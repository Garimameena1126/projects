Cleaning the data is an essential step in preparing the dataset for building a recommendation system. In this task, we will focus on handling missing values, removing irrelevant entries, and eliminating duplicate data. Follow the steps below to clean the data effectively.

### Step 1: Load the Data

To begin, load the dataset containing user browsing and purchase history, as well as product attributes. The data may be available in various formats such as CSV, JSON, or a database. Use the appropriate libraries or methods to load the data into your preferred programming environment.

Example code (Python):
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
```

### Step 2: Identify Missing Values

Missing values can occur in the dataset, and it's important to identify and handle them appropriately. Start by examining the dataset for any missing values and understanding their distribution.

Example code (Python):
```python
# Check for missing values in the dataset
missing_values = data.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values)
```

### Step 3: Handle Missing Values

Once you have identified the missing values, determine the best approach to handle them. There are several strategies you can employ, such as:

- **Dropping rows/columns**: If the missing values are relatively few or do not significantly impact the analysis, you can choose to drop the corresponding rows or columns.

- **Imputing values**: If the missing values are numeric, you can impute them with statistical measures like the mean, median, or mode. For categorical values, you can use the most frequent category.

- **Advanced imputation techniques**: In some cases, more advanced imputation techniques, such as using machine learning models to predict missing values, may be appropriate.

Choose the most suitable approach based on the nature and quantity of missing values in your dataset.

Example code (Python):
```python
# Drop rows with missing values
data = data.dropna()

# Impute missing numeric values with the mean
data['age'].fillna(data['age'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Impute missing categorical values with the most frequent category
data['gender'].fillna(data['gender'].mode()[0], inplace=True)
```

### Step 4: Remove Irrelevant Entries

After handling missing values, it's crucial to remove irrelevant entries that do not contribute to the recommendation system. Identify the criteria for relevance based on your project requirements. For example, you might want to exclude entries with incomplete information or those that are not relevant to the current scope of the system.

Example code (Python):
```python
# Remove irrelevant entries based on specific conditions
data = data[data['purchase_status'] == 'completed']
```

### Step 5: Remove Duplicate Entries

Duplicate entries can skew the analysis and recommendations. It's necessary to identify and remove duplicate rows from the dataset to ensure data integrity.

Example code (Python):
```python
# Remove duplicate entries based on all columns
data = data.drop_duplicates()

# Remove duplicate entries based on specific columns
data = data.drop_duplicates(subset=['user_id', 'product_id'])
```

### Step 6: Save the Cleaned Data

Once you have completed the data cleaning process, it's advisable to save the cleaned dataset for future use.

Example code (Python):
```python
# Save the cleaned data to a new CSV file
data.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
```

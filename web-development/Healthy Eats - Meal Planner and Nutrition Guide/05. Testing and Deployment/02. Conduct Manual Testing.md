# Conduct Manual Testing

## Step 1: Understand the Testing Scope

1. Identify the key functionalities: 
   - Review the project requirements and identify the essential functionalities that need to be tested.
   - Make a list of the main features, user interactions, and expected behaviors.

2. Define test scenarios:
   - Break down each functionality into specific test scenarios that cover different use cases and edge cases.
   - Consider inputs, expected outputs, and any specific conditions that need to be tested.

## Step 2: Prepare Test Cases

3. Create a test plan:
   - Organize your testing approach by creating a test plan document or spreadsheet.
   - Include details such as the test scenario, steps to reproduce, expected results, and actual results.

4. Write test cases:
   - For each test scenario, write detailed test cases that describe the steps to execute and the expected outcomes.
   - Include any specific inputs or preconditions required for the test case.

## Step 3: Execute Test Cases

5. Set up the test environment:
   - Ensure that the project is deployed or running in a suitable environment for testing.
   - Make sure any required test data or configurations are in place.

6. Execute test cases:
   - Follow the steps outlined in the test cases to perform the tests.
   - Enter inputs, interact with the user interface, and perform actions as specified.
   - Record the actual results, including any deviations or issues encountered during testing.

7. Test various scenarios:
   - Execute test cases that cover different user inputs, edge cases, and boundary conditions.
   - Test different combinations of inputs and variations in user behavior.

8. Record observations and issues:
   - Note down any unexpected behavior, errors, or inconsistencies encountered during testing.
   - Include detailed descriptions, screenshots, or videos to document the issues.

## Step 4: Validate Results and Address Issues

9. Compare actual results with expected results:
   - Review the recorded observations and compare them with the expected results specified in the test cases.
   - Identify any discrepancies and classify them as defects or areas for improvement.

10. Log issues:
    - Create bug reports or issue tickets for each identified defect or improvement area.
    - Include relevant information such as steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

11. Prioritize and address issues:
    - Prioritize the reported issues based on their severity and impact on the user experience.
    - Assign the issues to the development team and track their resolution.

12. Retest fixes:
    - Once the reported issues are resolved, retest the fixes to ensure they have been successfully addressed.
    - Update the issue tracker or bug report with the retest results.

## Step 5: Document Test Results

13. Prepare a test summary report:
    - Compile the results of the manual testing into a test summary report.
    - Include information such as the number of test cases executed, pass/fail status, and a summary of identified issues.

14. Include test artifacts:
    - Attach relevant artifacts, such as screenshots, videos, or logs, to support the test results and provide additional context.

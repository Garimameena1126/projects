# Beginner's Guide: Allowing Users to Set Reminders and Send Notifications

In this guide, we will learn how to allow users to set reminders for activities and send notifications in your application. We'll assume that you have already implemented the necessary backend server and frontend components for managing activities and user accounts. Now, let's focus on adding the functionality to set reminders and send notifications.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Familiarity with a web framework (e.g., Express.js, Django)
- Backend server set up and running
- Frontend components implemented for managing activities and user accounts

## Steps

### Step 1: Choose a Push Notification Service
1. Select a push notification service that provides the infrastructure for sending notifications to users. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a popular choice.
2. Set up an account and configure the necessary credentials and configurations in your project.

### Step 2: Implement Backend Endpoints for Setting Reminders
1. Create an API endpoint in your backend server to handle setting reminders for activities.
2. Define the necessary request parameters, such as the activity ID and the desired reminder time.
3. In the endpoint implementation, process the request and store the reminder details in your database.

### Step 3: Implement Push Notification Functionality
1. Integrate the push notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) into your backend server.
2. Set up the necessary configurations and credentials to establish a connection with the push notification service.
3. Implement a function in your backend server that sends a push notification to a specific user.
4. This function should take input parameters such as the user's device token and the notification message.

### Step 4: Add Reminder Feature to Frontend
1. Create a user interface component in your frontend to allow users to set reminders for activities.
2. Collect the necessary input from the user, such as the activity ID and the reminder time.
3. When the user submits the reminder, send a request to the backend API endpoint implemented in Step 2.

### Step 5: Handle Notifications in the Frontend
1. Implement the necessary functionality in your frontend to handle incoming notifications.
2. Subscribe to the push notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) and receive device tokens for the users.
3. When a notification is received, display it to the user in a notification center or similar component.


**Task: Set up a database connection to MongoDB**

1. **Install MongoDB**: If you haven't already, install MongoDB on your local machine or set up a MongoDB cluster on a cloud platform. Refer to the MongoDB documentation for installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2. **Create a new MongoDB database**: Open the MongoDB client (either through the command line or a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass) and create a new database for your project. Choose a suitable name for your database, such as "appointments_db".

3. **Install the MongoDB driver**: In your project directory, install the MongoDB driver for Node.js using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   npm install mongodb
   ```

   This will install the necessary MongoDB driver package for connecting to the MongoDB database from your Node.js application.

4. **Require the MongoDB driver in your Node.js application**: In your Node.js application file (e.g., `app.js`), require the MongoDB driver by adding the following line at the top of your file:

   ```javascript
   const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
   ```

   This line imports the `MongoClient` class from the MongoDB driver package, allowing you to connect to the database.

5. **Set up the database connection**: Inside your Node.js application file, add the following code to establish a connection to the MongoDB database:

   ```javascript
   const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'; // Replace with your MongoDB connection URI
   const client = new MongoClient(uri);

   async function connectToDatabase() {
     try {
       // Connect to the MongoDB database
       await client.connect();
       console.log('Connected to the database');

       // Specify the database and collection to use
       const database = client.db('appointments_db');
       const collection = database.collection('appointments');

       // Perform database operations (e.g., querying, inserting, updating)
       // ...

     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error connecting to the database:', error);
     }
   }

   // Call the connectToDatabase function to establish the connection
   connectToDatabase();
   ```

   In the code snippet above, replace `'mongodb://localhost:27017'` with the actual connection URI for your MongoDB database. The URI should include the hostname (e.g., `localhost`), port number (e.g., `27017`), and any additional options if required.

6. **Test the database connection**: Save the changes to your Node.js application file and run your application using the command `node app.js` in your terminal. If the connection is successful, you should see the message "Connected to the database" in the console. If there are any errors, double-check your connection URI and ensure that MongoDB is running.

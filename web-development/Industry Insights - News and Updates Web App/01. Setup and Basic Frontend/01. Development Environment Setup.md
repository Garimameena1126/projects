# Setting Up Development Environment

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment for building a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with React framework. We will cover the installation of necessary tools and frameworks such as Visual Studio Code and Node.js. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Installing Visual Studio Code

1. Download Visual Studio Code: Visit the official Visual Studio Code website (https://code.visualstudio.com) and download the installer suitable for your operating system.

2. Install Visual Studio Code: Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard prompts to install Visual Studio Code on your system. Choose the desired options during the installation process, such as adding it to the system path.

3. Verify Installation: Once the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command to verify that Visual Studio Code is installed correctly:

    ```bash
    code --version
    ```
    
    If the command displays the version number of Visual Studio Code, it means the installation was successful.

## Step 2: Installing Node.js

1. Download Node.js: Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version suitable for your operating system. Choose the installer package based on your OS.

2. Install Node.js: Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard prompts to install Node.js on your system. Accept the default installation settings unless you have specific preferences.

3. Verify Installation: After the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command to check if Node.js is installed successfully:

    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
    
    If the command displays the version number of Node.js, it indicates a successful installation.

4. Verify npm Installation: npm (Node Package Manager) is installed automatically along with Node.js. To verify its installation, enter the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    npm --version
    ```
    
    If the command shows the version number of npm, it means npm is installed correctly.

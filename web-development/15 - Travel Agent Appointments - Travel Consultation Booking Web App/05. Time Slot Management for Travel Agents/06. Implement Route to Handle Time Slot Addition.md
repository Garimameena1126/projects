1. **Open the server-side code**: Locate the file or module where you handle the server-side routes or controllers. This is typically where you define the routes and their corresponding logic. 

2. **Define a route for handling time slot additions**: Inside the server-side code, define a new route that will handle the addition of new time slots. This route should listen for HTTP POST requests to a specific endpoint. 

   ```javascript
   // Assuming you're using Express.js
   app.post('/timeslots', (req, res) => {
     // Handle the time slot addition logic
   });
   ```

   In the example above, the route is defined with the endpoint `/timeslots` and is set to handle POST requests.

3. **Retrieve the submitted time slot data**: Within the route's callback function, retrieve the time slot data submitted by the travel agent. This data can be accessed from the request object's body.

   ```javascript
   const { date, startTime, endTime, location } = req.body;
   ```

   Make sure to adapt the code based on your server-side framework or library.

4. **Update the database**: With the retrieved time slot data, update the database accordingly. This step will depend on your specific data storage mechanism and implementation. For example, if you're using a database ORM like Mongoose for MongoDB, you can create a new time slot document and save it to the database.

   ```javascript
   const TimeSlot = require('../models/TimeSlot');

   // Create a new time slot document
   const newTimeSlot = new TimeSlot({
     date,
     startTime,
     endTime,
     location,
   });

   // Save the new time slot to the database
   newTimeSlot.save()
     .then(() => {
       // Time slot saved successfully
       res.status(200).json({ message: 'Time slot added successfully.' });
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Handle the error
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to save the time slot.' });
     });
   ```

   In the code above, the `TimeSlot` model represents the schema and model for time slots. You create a new instance of the `TimeSlot` model, populate it with the submitted data, and save it to the database. Handle success and error cases accordingly.

5. **Handle server errors**: If any errors occur during the database update process, handle them appropriately and provide meaningful error responses to the client.

   ```javascript
   // Assuming an error occurred while saving the time slot to the database
   res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while saving the time slot.' });
   ```

   Adjust the error handling code based on your server-side setup and error handling approach.

6. **Test the route**: Test the route using a tool like Postman or by submitting a form from the frontend. Ensure that the route properly handles the addition of new time slots and updates the database accordingly.


## Module 1: Data Collection and Exploration

### Task: Explore and Analyze the Dataset

To understand the dataset's structure, variables, and possible relationships, we'll follow these steps:

1. Import Required Libraries
2. Load the Dataset
3. Explore Dataset Structure
4. Analyze Dataset Variables
5. Identify Relationships

Let's dive into each step:

### 1. Import Required Libraries

Before we begin, let's import the necessary libraries for data exploration and analysis. In this guide, we'll use Python and some popular libraries such as pandas and matplotlib.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### 2. Load the Dataset

To start exploring the dataset, we need to load it into our program. Assuming you have the dataset file (e.g., flight_data.csv) available, we'll use pandas to read the data and create a DataFrame.

```python
# Replace 'flight_data.csv' with the actual file path or URL of your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('flight_data.csv')
```

Make sure to provide the correct file path or URL to your dataset in the `read_csv` function.

### 3. Explore Dataset Structure

To understand the structure of the dataset, we'll examine its basic characteristics and get an overview of the data.

```python
# View the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())

# Check the dimensions of the dataset (rows, columns)
print(df.shape)

# Get a summary of the dataset's columns and their data types
print(df.info())

# Check for any missing values in the dataset
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

The above code snippets will display the first few rows of the dataset, its dimensions (rows and columns), an overview of column names and data types, and the number of missing values in each column.

### 4. Analyze Dataset Variables

Next, we'll analyze the variables in the dataset to gain insights into their distributions and statistical summaries.

```python
# Generate descriptive statistics for numerical variables
print(df.describe())

# Calculate the correlation between variables
print(df.corr())
```

By running the code above, you'll obtain descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles) for numerical variables and the correlation matrix, which indicates the relationships between different variables.

### 5. Identify Relationships

To identify relationships between variables, we can visualize the data using various plots and charts. Here are a few examples:

#### Histograms

```python
# Plot a histogram of the 'price' variable
plt.hist(df['price'], bins=20)
plt.xlabel('Price')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Flight Prices')
plt.show()
```

#### Scatter Plots

```python
# Plot a scatter plot between 'departure_delay' and 'arrival_delay'
plt.scatter(df['departure_delay'], df['arrival_delay'])
plt.xlabel('Departure Delay')
plt.ylabel('Arrival Delay')
plt.title('Relationship between Departure Delay and Arrival Delay')
plt.show()
```

#### Box Plots

```python
# Plot a box plot of 'price' grouped by 'airline'
plt.boxplot(df['price'], by='airline')
plt.xlabel('Airline')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.title('Flight Prices by Airline')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

These examples demonstrate how to create histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to visualize the relationships between variables in the dataset.

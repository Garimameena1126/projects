To make your website mobile-friendly and ensure it adapts well to different screen sizes, you'll need to follow responsive design principles. This involves using CSS media queries and other techniques to adjust the layout, typography, and other elements of your website based on the device being used.

Follow the steps below to incorporate responsive design principles into your project:

Step 1: Add the Meta Viewport Tag
- Open the HTML file(s) where you want to add the viewport meta tag.
- Inside the `<head>` section, add the following meta tag:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
- This meta tag ensures that the device's width is set to the width of the screen and provides the initial zoom level.

Step 2: Use CSS Media Queries
- Create a new CSS file or open the existing one for your project.
- At the bottom of your CSS file, start by targeting specific screen sizes using media queries. For example:
```css
/* Styles for screens smaller than 768px */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  /* Write CSS rules specific to smaller screens */
}

/* Styles for screens between 768px and 991px */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {
  /* Write CSS rules specific to medium-sized screens */
}

/* Styles for screens larger than 992px */
@media (min-width: 992px) {
  /* Write CSS rules specific to larger screens */
}
```
- Inside each media query, write the CSS rules to adjust the layout, typography, or other elements according to the target screen size.

Step 3: Create Responsive Layouts
- Start by designing the mobile layout first, as it usually provides a simpler and more focused user experience.
- Use CSS techniques such as Flexbox or Grid to create a responsive grid system for your layout.
- Ensure that elements stack vertically or adjust their positions appropriately on smaller screens.
- Gradually enhance the layout for larger screens by using media queries to introduce additional columns or rearrange elements.

Step 4: Adjust Typography and Images
- Consider the readability of your text on different screen sizes.
- Use relative font sizes, such as percentages or `em` units, to allow text to adjust based on the parent container or screen size.
- Optimize images by using responsive image techniques, such as `srcset` and `sizes` attributes, to serve appropriate image sizes based on the device's capabilities.

Step 5: Test and Refine
- Preview your website on various devices, screen sizes, and orientations to ensure the responsive design works as intended.
- Use browser developer tools to simulate different screen sizes and test your website's responsiveness.
- Make adjustments as needed, fixing any layout issues or elements that do not display properly on specific devices.

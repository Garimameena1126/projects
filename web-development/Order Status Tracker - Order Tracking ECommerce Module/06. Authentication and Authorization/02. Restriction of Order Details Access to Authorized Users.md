# Restriction of Order Details Access to Authorized Users

In this guide, we will learn how to restrict access to order details only to authorized users in the Order Status Tracker module of an eCommerce application. By implementing this feature, we can ensure that sensitive order information is protected and can only be accessed by users with the necessary permissions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this guide, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of web development.
- Familiarity with a backend framework (e.g., Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails).
- An existing Order Status Tracker module in your eCommerce application.

Now, let's dive into the step-by-step process of implementing order details access restrictions for authorized users.

## Step 1: User Authentication

The first step is to ensure that user authentication is in place. We need to have a system where users can register, log in, and obtain a unique authentication token upon successful login.

To implement user authentication, follow these steps:

1. Set up a user model with fields such as `username`, `email`, and `password`.
2. Implement user registration functionality, allowing users to create an account.
3. Create a login endpoint that accepts credentials (username/email and password) and generates an authentication token upon successful authentication.
4. Secure sensitive user information such as passwords by hashing them before storing in the database.

Make sure to test the user authentication system thoroughly to ensure it's working correctly.

## Step 2: Authorization Roles and Permissions

Next, we need to establish authorization roles and permissions within our system. By defining roles and assigning appropriate permissions, we can control access to different parts of the application.

To implement authorization roles and permissions, follow these steps:

1. Identify the necessary roles and permissions for your application. In our case, we need at least two roles: "admin" and "user."
2. Define the roles and their corresponding permissions. For example, the "admin" role might have full access to all orders, while the "user" role may only have access to their own orders.
3. Associate roles with users in the database. Add a `role` field to the user model and assign the appropriate role when creating a new user.

## Step 3: Modify Order Details Endpoint

Now, we will modify the existing endpoint responsible for retrieving order details to enforce access restrictions based on user roles.

To modify the order details endpoint, follow these steps:

1. Identify the endpoint responsible for fetching order details. It could be something like `/orders/{orderId}`.
2. Add authorization logic to this endpoint, ensuring that only authorized users can access the order details.
3. Within the endpoint code, retrieve the user's role from the authentication token.
4. Check if the user's role has the necessary permission to access the requested order details. If not, return an appropriate error response.
5. If the user has the required permission, retrieve and return the order details as usual.

## Step 4: Test and Verify

The final step is to test and verify that the order details access restriction is working correctly.

To test the implementation, follow these steps:

1. Start your application and ensure the user authentication and authorization systems are functioning properly.
2. Log in with different user accounts, including both "admin" and "user" roles.
3. Attempt to access order details using the modified endpoint with different user roles.
4. Verify that users with the "admin" role can access all order details, while users with the "user" role can only access their own order details.
5. If any issues are found, review your code and troubleshoot accordingly.

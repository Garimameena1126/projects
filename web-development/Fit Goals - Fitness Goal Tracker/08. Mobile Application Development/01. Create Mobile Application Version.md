# Creating a Mobile Application Version of the Fitness Goal Tracker

In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating a mobile application version of the Fitness Goal Tracker using the React Native framework. React Native allows us to build native mobile applications using JavaScript, leveraging our existing knowledge and codebase from the web application.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up on your development environment:

- Node.js and npm: Install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org) to get both Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
- React Native CLI: Install React Native CLI globally by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
  
  ```
  npm install -g react-native-cli
  ```

## Step 1: Set Up the React Native Project

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your React Native project.
2. Run the following command to create a new React Native project named "FitnessGoalTracker":

   ```
   npx react-native init FitnessGoalTracker
   ```

   This command will set up a new React Native project with the necessary files and dependencies.

3. Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd FitnessGoalTracker
   ```

## Step 2: Adapt Existing Features and Functionalities

1. Copy the relevant code files and assets from the web version of the Fitness Goal Tracker into the React Native project.

   For example, copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that handle user registration, authentication, fitness goal creation, tracking, and progress visualization. Also, copy any relevant assets such as images or icons.

2. Replace any HTML-specific code with React Native components.

   React Native provides a set of pre-built components that mimic native mobile UI elements. For example, replace `<div>` elements with `<View>` components, `<button>` elements with `<TouchableOpacity>` or `<Button>` components, and so on.

3. Modify the CSS styles to use React Native's style props.

   React Native uses a different approach to styling compared to web development. Instead of using CSS classes, you'll use style props directly on components. Adapt the existing CSS styles to React Native's style prop syntax.

4. Refactor any JavaScript code that relies on browser-specific features or APIs.

   React Native runs JavaScript code in a JavaScript runtime specifically designed for mobile applications, so certain browser-specific features or APIs may not be available. Make necessary changes to adapt the code to the React Native environment.

5. Test the adapted features and functionalities within the React Native app.

   Run the React Native development server using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   npx react-native start
   ```

   Then, open a new terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the project directory. Run the app on a connected Android or iOS device or emulator using the following commands:

   For Android:
   ```
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

   For iOS:
   ```
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

   Verify that the adapted features and functionalities work as expected on the mobile application.

## Step 3: Ensure Seamless Synchronization

To ensure seamless synchronization between the web and mobile versions of the Fitness Goal Tracker, we need to set up a mechanism to synchronize data between the two platforms.

1. Set up an API or backend service that both the web and mobile applications can communicate with.

   This API will act as a bridge between the two platforms, allowing them to exchange data. You can use Node.js with Express or any other backend framework to create the API.

2. Implement endpoints in the API to handle data synchronization operations.

   For example, create endpoints for user registration, login, fitness goal

 creation, progress tracking, and any other operations required by the Fitness Goal Tracker.

3. Modify the web and mobile applications to communicate with the API.

   Update the existing API calls in both applications to point to the endpoints provided by the API.

4. Test the synchronization functionality.

   Verify that changes made on one platform (e.g., web) reflect on the other platform (e.g., mobile) and vice versa. Test different scenarios, such as creating a fitness goal on the web and seeing it appear on the mobile app or updating progress on the mobile app and observing the changes on the web.

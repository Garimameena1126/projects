# Create a Dashboard Layout with Sections for Goals, Progress, and Workout Tracking

In this task, we will create a dashboard layout for our workout tracking app. The dashboard will include sections for goals, progress, and workout tracking. We will design the layout using HTML and CSS. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create the HTML Structure

1. Open the `index.html` file in your code editor.

2. Inside the `<body>` element, add a `<div>` element with the class `dashboard-container` to serve as the container for the dashboard layout.

   ```html
   <body>
     <div class="dashboard-container">
       <!-- Dashboard sections will be added here -->
     </div>
   </body>
   ```

3. Within the `dashboard-container`, add three `<div>` elements with classes `goal-section`, `progress-section`, and `workout-section` to represent the different sections of the dashboard.

   ```html
   <div class="dashboard-container">
     <div class="goal-section">
       <!-- Goal section content will be added here -->
     </div>
     <div class="progress-section">
       <!-- Progress section content will be added here -->
     </div>
     <div class="workout-section">
       <!-- Workout section content will be added here -->
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

## Step 2: Style the Dashboard Layout with CSS

1. Create a new CSS file called `style.css` in your project directory.

2. Link the CSS file to the HTML file by adding the following `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` element of the `index.html` file.

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   ```

3. Open the `style.css` file.

4. Add the following CSS code to style the dashboard layout:

   ```css
   /* Set the height and background color of the dashboard container */
   .dashboard-container {
     height: 100vh;
     background-color: #f5f5f5;
   }

   /* Style the goal section */
   .goal-section {
     background-color: #fff;
     padding: 20px;
     margin-bottom: 20px;
   }

   /* Style the progress section */
   .progress-section {
     background-color: #fff;
     padding: 20px;
     margin-bottom: 20px;
   }

   /* Style the workout section */
   .workout-section {
     background-color: #fff;
     padding: 20px;
   }
   ```

   This code sets the height and background color of the dashboard container and applies styling to each section.

## Step 3: Add Content to the Dashboard Sections

1. Inside the `<div>` element with class `goal-section`, add the following HTML code to represent the goals section:

   ```html
   <div class="goal-section">
     <h2>Goals</h2>
     <!-- Add your goals content here -->
   </div>
   ```

2. Inside the `<div>` element with class `progress-section`, add the following HTML code to represent the progress section:

   ```html
   <div class="progress-section">
     <h2>Progress</h2>
     <!-- Add your progress content here -->
   </div>
   ```

3. Inside the `<div>` element with class `workout-section`, add the following HTML code to represent the workout tracking section:

   ```html
   <div class="workout-section">
     <h2>Workout Tracking</h2>
     <!-- Add your workout tracking content here -->
   </div>
   ```

4. Add content specific to each section as per your project requirements. For example, you can add text, buttons, forms, or other elements to represent goals, progress, and workout tracking.

## Step 4: Preview the Dashboard Layout

1. Save the changes to both the `index.html` and `style.css` files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

   You should now see the dashboard layout with sections for goals, progress, and workout tracking. Each section should be styled according to the CSS rules defined in the `style.css` file.

#### Task: Test the webpage's responsiveness and ensure it displays correctly on different devices.

1. Open the HTML file ("index.html") in a web browser of your choice.
2. Resize the browser window to simulate different screen sizes and resolutions.
   - Drag the edges of the browser window to make it smaller or larger.
   - Alternatively, you can use the browser's built-in developer tools to simulate different device sizes. For example, in Google Chrome, right-click on the webpage, select "Inspect", and then click the device icon in the top-left corner of the developer tools panel to choose a specific device or set a custom device size.
3. Observe how the webpage layout and content respond to different screen sizes.
   - Check if the navigation bar, class schedule display section, and other elements adjust their position and appearance as the screen size changes.
   - Ensure that the text, images, and other content elements are legible and properly aligned.
   - Verify that there is no horizontal scrolling or overlapping of elements.
4. Repeat the resizing and observation process on various devices or device emulators.
   - Test on a desktop computer or laptop with different screen resolutions.
   - Test on smartphones and tablets of different sizes and orientations.
5. Make note of any layout issues or content misalignments that you observe during the testing process.
6. Inspect the HTML and CSS code to identify potential causes of the issues.
   - Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the HTML structure and CSS styles applied to the problematic elements.
7. Apply necessary adjustments to the HTML and CSS code to fix the issues.
   - Modify the CSS styles, such as adjusting margins, paddings, widths, or using media queries, to ensure proper responsiveness.
   - Consider using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to simplify responsive design.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 until the webpage displays correctly and responsively across different devices.
9. Validate the HTML and CSS code to ensure it adheres to best practices and standards.
   - Use online validators or linting tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/) and CSS Validator (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any syntax errors or potential issues in your code.
   - Address any warnings or errors reported by the validators.
10. Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure all functionality and interactivity of the webpage works as expected.
   - Test any interactive features, such as clicking on class names or timings, and verify that additional details are displayed correctly.
   - Test any form submissions, user authentication, or database integrations to ensure they function properly.
11. Make any required refinements or bug fixes based on the testing and validation results.
   - Update the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as necessary to address any identified issues or improve the user experience.
12. Repeat the testing and refinement process iteratively until you are satisfied with the webpage's responsiveness, appearance, and functionality.

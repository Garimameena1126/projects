## Step-by-Step Guide: Adding Social Media Sharing Buttons to the Website

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of adding social media sharing buttons to your website. These buttons will allow users to share fitness tips on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. We will also customize the shared content and track the number of shares. Let's get started!

### Step 1: Obtain Social Media Sharing Buttons Code

1. Choose the social media platforms you want to include for sharing, such as Facebook and Twitter.

2. Visit the developer documentation for each platform to obtain the necessary code for sharing buttons.

   - For Facebook, visit the [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button) page.

   - For Twitter, visit the [Twitter Developer Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/overview) page.

3. Follow the instructions provided by each platform to generate the code for the sharing buttons. Customize the appearance and options according to your preferences.

4. Copy the generated code for each platform.

### Step 2: Insert Social Media Sharing Buttons in HTML

1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.

   ```bash
   code index.html
   ```

2. Locate the section of the HTML where you want to place the social media sharing buttons. This could be within the content section or a specific div element.

3. Insert the copied code for each platform in the appropriate location within the HTML code.

   For example, if you want to add Facebook and Twitter sharing buttons side by side, the code might look like this:

   ```html
   <div class="social-sharing">
       <!-- Facebook sharing button code -->
       <div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://example.com" data-layout="button"></div>

       <!-- Twitter sharing button code -->
       <a href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share-button" data-url="https://example.com" data-text="Check out this fitness tip!" data-show-count="true">Tweet</a>
   </div>
   ```

4. Customize the code further as needed, such as specifying the URL to be shared or adding additional parameters.

5. Save the `index.html` file.

### Step 3: Customize Shared Content and Images

1. To customize the shared content, open the `index.html` file in a text editor.

   ```bash
   code index.html
   ```

2. Locate the section of the HTML where the fitness tip content is displayed.

3. Ensure that the fitness tip content is properly structured with appropriate HTML elements, such as paragraphs or headings. This will ensure the shared content appears correctly.

4. If you want to include an image in the shared content, make sure to add an `<img>` tag with the desired image URL within the content section.

   ```html
   <div class="fitness-tip">
       <h2>Tip of the Day</h2>
       <p>Here is an important fitness tip for you:</p>
       <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse hendrerit quam a neque scelerisque, in congue turpis vestibulum.</p>
       <img src="fitness-tip-image.jpg" alt="Fitness Tip Image">
   </div>
   ```

5. Save the `index.html` file.

### Step 4: Track and Display the Number of Shares

1. Follow the documentation provided by the respective social media platforms to enable tracking and displaying the number of shares.

   - For Facebook, visit the [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button/#settings) page and explore the options for tracking and displaying share counts.



   - For Twitter, visit the [Twitter Developer Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/overview) page to learn about options for displaying share counts.

2. Implement the necessary code or configuration to enable share count tracking and display according to your chosen platform's guidelines.

3. Test the functionality by sharing a fitness tip through the social media sharing buttons and verifying that the share count is accurately updated and displayed.

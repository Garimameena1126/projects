To enable the editing and deletion of leads in your application, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Add Edit and Delete Buttons

In the table or list where you display the leads, add an "Edit" button and a "Delete" button for each lead entry. These buttons will allow users to perform the corresponding actions.

```html
<!-- Example HTML structure for displaying leads -->
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Email</th>
      <th>Phone</th>
      <th>Actions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>John Doe</td>
      <td>john@example.com</td>
      <td>123-456-7890</td>
      <td>
        <button class="edit-button">Edit</button>
        <button class="delete-button">Delete</button>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <!-- More lead entries -->
  </tbody>
</table>
```

#### Step 2: Handle Edit Button Click

Add an event listener to the "Edit" buttons to capture the click event. When a user clicks the "Edit" button, you can initiate the editing process for the corresponding lead.

```javascript
// Example JavaScript code to handle the edit button click event
const editButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.edit-button');

editButtons.forEach((button) => {
  button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    const leadId = event.target.closest('tr').dataset.leadId;
    // Perform the necessary actions to initiate the edit process
    // You may display a form or navigate to an edit page
  });
});
```

#### Step 3: Handle Delete Button Click

Similarly, add an event listener to the "Delete" buttons to capture the click event. When a user clicks the "Delete" button, you can prompt for confirmation and delete the corresponding lead if confirmed.

```javascript
// Example JavaScript code to handle the delete button click event
const deleteButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.delete-button');

deleteButtons.forEach((button) => {
  button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    const leadId = event.target.closest('tr').dataset.leadId;
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this lead?')) {
      // Perform the necessary actions to delete the lead
      // This may involve making an API request or updating the database
    }
  });
});
```

#### Step 4: Implement Lead Editing

For the editing functionality, you have a few options depending on your application's design:

- Display an edit form directly in the table or list row itself. When the user clicks the "Edit" button, replace the row's content with an editable form containing the lead's details. Provide a "Save" button to save the changes.

- Navigate to a separate page or modal where users can edit the lead's details. Pass the lead's identifier (e.g., ID) as a parameter or store it in a temporary storage mechanism (e.g., session or local storage).

Ensure that you capture the changes made by the user and update the lead's details accordingly.

#### Step 5: Implement Lead Deletion

To delete a lead, you'll need to handle the delete action on the server side. This typically involves making an API request or updating the database directly.

The exact implementation will depend on your backend technology and database system. Consult the relevant documentation or guides for your chosen technology to understand how to handle lead deletion.

#### Step 6: Test and

 Verify

After implementing the editing and deletion functionality, thoroughly test it to ensure it functions as expected. Verify that you can edit lead details and see the changes reflected in the application. Similarly, verify that leads can be deleted successfully and are removed from the system.

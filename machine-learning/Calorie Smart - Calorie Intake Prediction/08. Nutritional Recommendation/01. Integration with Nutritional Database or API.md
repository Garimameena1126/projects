# Nutritional Recommendation 

## Extending the Project for Personalized Nutritional Recommendations

In this task, we will extend the existing project to provide personalized nutritional recommendations based on the predicted calorie intake. We will utilize an existing nutritional database or API to retrieve food information and suggest appropriate meal plans or dietary adjustments.

To accomplish this task, we will follow the step-by-step guide outlined below.

### Step 1: Choose a Nutritional Database or API

The first step is to choose a nutritional database or API that contains detailed food information such as nutritional values, ingredients, and serving sizes. There are several options available, including:

- USDA Food Composition Databases: The USDA provides comprehensive nutritional information for a wide range of food items.
- Nutritionix API: A popular API that provides access to a large food database with detailed nutritional information.
- Open Food Facts: A collaborative food database with nutritional data contributed by users worldwide.

Choose the one that best suits your project requirements. For the purpose of this guide, we will use the Nutritionix API.

### Step 2: Set up API Access

To access the chosen nutritional database or API, you will need to set up API access credentials. Follow these sub-steps to get started:

#### 2.1 Sign up for an API Key

Visit the website of the chosen nutritional database or API provider and sign up for an account if required. Once registered, you will usually receive an API key that grants you access to the API's resources.

#### 2.2 Install Required Libraries

To interact with the API, you may need to install specific libraries or SDKs. For example, if you're using Python, you might need to install the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the API.

Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in your command-line interface or terminal:

```bash
pip install requests
```

#### 2.3 Store API Credentials

To keep your API credentials secure, it's best to store them in a separate configuration file or environment variables. Create a file named `config.ini` and store the API key as follows:

```ini
[API]
api_key = YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

### Step 3: Retrieve Food Information from the API

Now that we have access to the nutritional database or API, we can retrieve food information based on the predicted calorie intake. Follow these steps to retrieve food information:

#### 3.1 Import Required Libraries

In your project code, import the necessary libraries. In this example, we'll use Python and the `requests` library:

```python
import requests
import configparser
```

#### 3.2 Load API Credentials

Load the API key from the configuration file (`config.ini`) using the `configparser` library:

```python
config = configparser.ConfigParser()
config.read('config.ini')
api_key = config['API']['api_key']
```

#### 3.3 Make API Requests

To retrieve food information, we need to send HTTP requests to the API endpoint. Use the following code snippet as an example:

```python
def get_food_information(calorie_intake):
    url = 'https://api.nutritionix.com/v1_1/search'
    params = {
        'appId': 'YOUR_APP_ID',
        'appKey': api_key,
        'results': '0:5',  # Number of results to retrieve
        'fields': 'item_name,nf_calories,nf_total_fat',  # Specify required fields
        'sort': 'nf_calories',  # Sort results by calorie content
        'cal_min': calorie_intake - 100,  # Minimum calorie value
        'cal_max': calorie_intake + 100,  # Maximum calorie value
    }

    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    data = response.json()

    return data['hits'] if 'hits' in data else []
```

The above code snippet demonstrates how to send a GET request to the Nutritionix API to search for food items within a specific calorie range. Adjust the parameters according to your specific requirements.

#### 3.4 Process and Display Results

Process the API response and display the retrieved food information:

```python
def display_food_information(food_items):
    for item in food_items:
        item_name = item['fields']['item_name']
        calories = item['fields']['nf_calories']
        total_fat = item['fields']['nf_total_fat']

        print(f'Food Item: {item_name}')
        print(f'Calories: {calories} kcal')
        print(f'Total Fat: {total_fat} g')
        print('---')
```

### Step 4: Integrate Nutritional Recommendations into the Application

Now that we have retrieved food information based on the predicted calorie intake, we can integrate the nutritional recommendations into the application. Here's an example of how to do this:

```python
def predict_calorie_intake(user_data):
    # Your existing code for calorie intake prediction
    ...

    return predicted_calories


def provide_nutritional_recommendations(user_data):
    calorie_intake = predict_calorie_intake(user_data)
    food_items = get_food_information(calorie_intake)
    display_food_information(food_items)
```

In the above code snippet, `predict_calorie_intake` is a function that utilizes your existing model to predict the calorie intake based on user data. Once the prediction is obtained, the `provide_nutritional_recommendations` function retrieves food information using the API and displays it to the user.

### Step 5: Test the Nutritional Recommendation Feature

To ensure the nutritional recommendation feature is working correctly, you should test it with sample user data. Here's an example of how to test the feature:

```python
user_data = {
    'age': 30,
    'gender': 'female',
    'weight': 65,
    'height': 160,
    'activity_level': 'moderate',
    'dietary_information': 'low-carb',
}

provide_nutritional_recommendations(user_data)
```

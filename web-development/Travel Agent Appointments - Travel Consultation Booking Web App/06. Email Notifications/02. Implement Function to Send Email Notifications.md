1. **Import Nodemailer**: Begin by importing the Nodemailer library in the file where you want to create the email notification function. Assuming you have already installed Nodemailer and configured it with a valid email account (as described in the previous task), add the following line at the top of your file:

   ```javascript
   const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
   ```

2. **Define the email notification function**: Create a new function that will handle sending email notifications. Choose an appropriate name for the function, such as `sendAppointmentNotification`. This function should take the appointment data as a parameter.

   ```javascript
   function sendAppointmentNotification(appointmentData) {
     // Code for sending email notifications
   }
   ```

   You can add any additional parameters to the function that you need to include in the email, such as the recipient's email address or the subject line.

3. **Configure the email options**: Inside the `sendAppointmentNotification` function, set up the email options. This includes specifying the sender, recipient, subject, and content of the email. Here's an example of how you can structure the email options:

   ```javascript
   function sendAppointmentNotification(appointmentData) {
     const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
       // Configure the transporter options if not already done
     });

     const mailOptions = {
       from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
       to: appointmentData.email, // Assuming appointmentData has the recipient's email address
       subject: 'Appointment Reminder',
       text: `Dear ${appointmentData.name},\n\nThis is a reminder for your appointment on ${appointmentData.date} at ${appointmentData.time}. Please be punctual.\n\nBest regards,\nYour Travel Agency`
     };
   }
   ```

   Customize the `from` field to use your email address or the appropriate sender's address. The `to` field should contain the email address of the appointment recipient, which can be extracted from the `appointmentData` object.

   Feel free to modify the email content according to your requirements. You can use template literals (`${variable}`) to include dynamic values from the `appointmentData` object, such as the recipient's name, appointment date, and time.

4. **Send the email**: Use the `transporter.sendMail` method to send the email using the configured transporter and email options. Add this code inside the `sendAppointmentNotification` function:

   ```javascript
   function sendAppointmentNotification(appointmentData) {
     const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
       // Configure the transporter options if not already done
     });

     const mailOptions = {
       from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
       to: appointmentData.email,
       subject: 'Appointment Reminder',
       text: `Dear ${appointmentData.name},\n\nThis is a reminder for your appointment on ${appointmentData.date} at ${appointmentData.time}. Please be punctual.\n\nBest regards,\nYour Travel Agency`
     };

     transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
       if (error) {
         console.error('Error sending email:', error);
       } else {
         console.log('Email sent:', info.response);
       }
     });
   }
   ```

   The `sendMail` function takes the `mailOptions` object as the first parameter and a callback function as the second parameter. The callback function handles any errors that occur during the email sending process and logs the response when the email is successfully sent.

5. **Call the function when a new appointment is scheduled**: In the part of your code where you handle the creation or scheduling of new appointments, call the `sendAppointmentNotification` function with the appropriate appointment data. For example:

   ```javascript
   const newAppointment = {
     name: 'John Doe',
     email: 'john.doe@example.com',
     date: '2023-06-25',
     time: '15:00'
   };

   sendAppointmentNotification(newAppointment);
   ```

   Replace the `newAppointment` object with the actual appointment data you have. This code snippet demonstrates how you can call the `sendAppointmentNotification` function with the appointment details immediately after creating a new appointment.

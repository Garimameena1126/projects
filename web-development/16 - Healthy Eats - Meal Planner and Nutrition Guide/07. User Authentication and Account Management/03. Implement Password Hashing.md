## Implementing Password Hashing and Secure Storage

In this task, you will enhance the security of your meal planner application by implementing password hashing and secure storage of user credentials. This ensures that user passwords are not stored in plain text and are protected against unauthorized access. Follow this step-by-step guide to implement password hashing and secure storage.

### Step 1: Choose a Password Hashing Algorithm

1. Research and choose a strong password hashing algorithm that is recommended for secure password storage. Common choices include bcrypt, Argon2, and scrypt.

2. Install the necessary libraries or modules for the chosen algorithm. For example, if using bcrypt, you may need to install the bcrypt library for your programming language.

### Step 2: Implement Password Hashing

1. In your server-side code, retrieve the user's password when registering or updating their password.

2. Use the chosen password hashing algorithm to hash the user's password. Refer to the documentation or examples provided for the specific library or module you are using.

3. Generate a random salt for each user and combine it with their password before hashing. The salt adds an extra layer of security by making each hashed password unique, even if the original passwords are the same.

4. Hash the combined password and salt using the chosen algorithm.

5. Store the hashed password and the salt in your user database or storage mechanism. Ensure that the password field is appropriately configured to accommodate the hashed password.

### Step 3: Verifying Passwords

1. When authenticating a user, retrieve the stored hashed password and salt associated with the user.

2. Retrieve the entered password from the login or password update form.

3. Combine the entered password with the stored salt.

4. Use the same password hashing algorithm and configuration as before to hash the combined password and salt.

5. Compare the generated hash with the stored hashed password. If they match, the entered password is correct.

### Step 4: Test Password Hashing and Verification

1. Create test cases to verify the password hashing and verification functionality.

2. Test the registration and password update flows to ensure that passwords are properly hashed and stored.

3. Test the login flow to verify that passwords are correctly verified during authentication.

4. Verify that the system rejects incorrect passwords and only allows access with the correct password.

### Step 5: Update Account Management Flows

1. Update the registration and password update forms to accommodate the hashed password and salt.

2. Modify any existing account management logic to include the new password hashing and verification steps.

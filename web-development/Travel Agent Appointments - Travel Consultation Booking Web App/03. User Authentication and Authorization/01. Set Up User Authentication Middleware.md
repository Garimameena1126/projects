# Set Up User Authentication Middleware

In this guide, we will set up user authentication middleware for the Travel Agent Appointments - Travel Consultation Booking Web App. User authentication is an essential part of any web application to ensure that only authorized users can access certain routes or perform specific actions. By implementing user authentication middleware, we can protect sensitive routes and provide a personalized experience to our users.

Let's follow the step-by-step process to set up user authentication middleware in the Travel Agent Appointments web app:

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Before we begin, let's make sure we have all the necessary dependencies installed. In our case, we will use Express.js as our web framework and Passport.js as the authentication middleware. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install express passport passport-local express-session
```

## Step 2: Configure Passport.js

Passport.js is a popular authentication library for Node.js. We need to configure it to work with our web app. Create a new file called `passport-config.js` in your project's root directory and add the following code:

```javascript
const passport = require('passport');
const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;

// Replace this with your user model
const User = require('./models/user');

passport.use(
  new LocalStrategy((username, password, done) => {
    User.findOne({ username: username }, (err, user) => {
      if (err) return done(err);
      if (!user) return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect username.' });
      if (!user.validPassword(password))
        return done(null, false, { message: 'Incorrect password.' });
      return done(null, user);
    });
  })
);

passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
  done(null, user.id);
});

passport.deserializeUser((id, done) => {
  User.findById(id, (err, user) => {
    done(err, user);
  });
});
```

Make sure to replace `./models/user` with the correct path to your user model file.

## Step 3: Configure Express.js

Next, we need to configure Express.js to use Passport.js for authentication. Open your main server file (e.g., `server.js` or `app.js`) and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');
const passport = require('passport');
const app = express();

// ...

// Add session middleware
app.use(
  session({
    secret: 'your-secret-key',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false
  })
);

// Initialize Passport.js
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());

// ...

// Define your routes after initializing Passport.js

// Example protected route
app.get('/dashboard', ensureAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
  res.render('dashboard');
});

// Example login route
app.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', { successRedirect: '/', failureRedirect: '/login' }));

// ...

// Middleware to check if the user is authenticated
function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/login');
}

// ...
```

In the code above, we've added the necessary middleware for session management and Passport.js initialization. We've also defined an example protected route (`/dashboard`) that can only be accessed by authenticated users. The `ensureAuthenticated` function serves as a middleware to check if a user is authenticated.

## Step 4: Implement User Authentication Routes

Now, we need to implement the routes for user authentication, such as login and logout. Add the following

code to your server file:

```javascript
// ...

// Example login route
app.get('/login', (req, res) => {
  res.render('login');
});

app.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', { successRedirect: '/', failureRedirect: '/login' }));

app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.logout();
  res.redirect('/login');
});

// ...
```

In the code above, we've added routes for the login and logout functionality. The `GET` route for `/login` renders a login form, while the `POST` route for `/login` handles the authentication process using Passport.js.

## Step 5: Protect Routes

Finally, you can protect specific routes by using the `ensureAuthenticated` middleware we defined earlier. For example, if you have a route that should only be accessible by authenticated users, you can modify it like this:

```javascript
app.get('/protected-route', ensureAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
  // Route logic goes here
});
```

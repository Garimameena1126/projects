# Beginner's Guide: Creating the Main HTML Structure for the Reviews and Ratings System

In this guide, we will help you create the main HTML structure for the reviews and ratings system. This structure will form the foundation of your user interface and provide a framework for displaying reviews and capturing new ones.

## Step 1: Set up the HTML File

To begin, open your preferred text editor and create a new HTML file. You can name it `index.html` or any other appropriate name. Add the following code to set up the basic HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Reviews and Ratings System</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Main HTML structure goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifies that this is an HTML5 document. The `<html>` tag represents the root element of the HTML file. Inside the `<head>` section, we set the character encoding, define the viewport for responsive design, and provide a title for the web page.

## Step 2: Create the Main Container

Inside the `<body>` section, we will create a main container to hold the reviews and ratings. This container will provide a structured layout for organizing our UI elements. Add the following code inside the `<body>` tag:

```html
<div id="reviews-container">
  <!-- Reviews and ratings content goes here -->
</div>
```

We use a `<div>` element with the `id` attribute set to "reviews-container" to create our main container. The `id` attribute is used to uniquely identify this element, which will be useful for styling and manipulation purposes.

## Step 3: Add a Heading

Let's add a heading to introduce the reviews and ratings system. This heading will provide a clear title for the user interface. Place the following code inside the `<div>` element:

```html
<h1>Reviews and Ratings</h1>
```

The `<h1>` tag represents the highest level of heading in HTML. It creates a prominent title for the reviews and ratings system.

## Step 4: Display Existing Reviews

Next, we will create a section to display the existing reviews along with their associated ratings. This section will provide users with an overview of the feedback received. Add the following code below the heading:

```html
<section id="existing-reviews">
  <!-- Existing reviews and ratings content goes here -->
</section>
```

Similar to the main container, we use a `<section>` element with the `id` attribute set to "existing-reviews" to create a dedicated area for the existing reviews.

## Step 5: Add the Review Submission Form

Now, we will implement a form for users to submit new reviews. This form will collect the necessary information, such as the reviewer's name, rating, and comments. Insert the following code below the existing reviews section:

```html
<section id="new-review">
  <h2>Add a Review</h2>
  <form id="review-form">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" required>

    <label for="rating">Rating:</label>
    <select id="rating" required>
      <option value="" disabled selected>Select a rating</option>
      <option value="1">1 Star</option>
      <option value="2">2 Stars</option>
      <option value="3">3 Stars</option>
      <option value="4">4 Stars</option>
      <option value="5">5 Stars</option>
   

 </select>

    <label for="comments">Comments:</label>
    <textarea id="comments" rows="4" required></textarea>

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</section>
```

In this code, we create a `<section>` element with the `id` attribute set to "new-review" to encompass the review submission form. Inside the section, we use an `<h2>` tag to provide a subheading for the form. The `<form>` tag represents the container for our form elements.

Within the form, we include several form fields: a text input for the reviewer's name, a select dropdown for the rating, and a textarea for the comments. Each form field is associated with a label using the `<label>` tag, which improves accessibility.

Lastly, we have a submit button for users to submit their reviews.

## Step 6: Finalize the HTML Structure

To complete the main HTML structure, make sure to close any remaining open tags. Your final code should look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Reviews and Ratings System</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="reviews-container">
    <h1>Reviews and Ratings</h1>
    <section id="existing-reviews">
      <!-- Existing reviews and ratings content goes here -->
    </section>
    <section id="new-review">
      <h2>Add a Review</h2>
      <form id="review-form">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" required>

        <label for="rating">Rating:</label>
        <select id="rating" required>
          <option value="" disabled selected>Select a rating</option>
          <option value="1">1 Star</option>
          <option value="2">2 Stars</option>
          <option value="3">3 Stars</option>
          <option value="4">4 Stars</option>
          <option value="5">5 Stars</option>
        </select>

        <label for="comments">Comments:</label>
        <textarea id="comments" rows="4" required></textarea>

        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </section>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

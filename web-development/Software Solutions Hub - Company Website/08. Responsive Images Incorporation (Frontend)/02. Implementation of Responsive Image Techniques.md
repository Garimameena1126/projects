# Implementing Responsive Image Techniques

In this task, we will implement responsive image techniques to ensure that our images adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. There are two common approaches for achieving this: using the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes, and implementing lazy loading. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Using the `srcset` and `sizes` Attributes

The `srcset` and `sizes` attributes allow us to provide different image sources and specify the image's display size based on the viewport width. Here's how to implement these attributes:

1. Locate the `<img>` tag for the image you want to make responsive in your HTML file.

2. Add the `srcset` attribute to the `<img>` tag. Specify multiple image sources along with their widths using the `w` unit. The browser will select the most appropriate image source based on the user's device capabilities and screen size. For example:

```html
<img src="image.jpg"
     srcset="image-small.jpg 480w, image-medium.jpg 768w, image-large.jpg 1200w"
     alt="Responsive Image">
```

In the example above, `image-small.jpg`, `image-medium.jpg`, and `image-large.jpg` are different versions of the same image optimized for different screen sizes.

3. Add the `sizes` attribute to indicate the image's display size relative to the viewport width. Use media queries to specify different display sizes for different screen widths. For example:

```html
<img src="image.jpg"
     srcset="image-small.jpg 480w, image-medium.jpg 768w, image-large.jpg 1200w"
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
     alt="Responsive Image">
```

In the example above, the image will display at 100% of the viewport width when the viewport is 768 pixels or smaller. For viewports larger than 768 pixels, the image will display at 50% of the viewport width.

## Step 2: Implementing Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a technique that defers the loading of images until they are about to appear in the user's viewport. This can significantly improve page load times, especially when dealing with large or numerous images. Let's see how to implement lazy loading:

1. Include a lazy loading library in your project. There are several options available, such as "lazysizes" and "lozad.js". For this guide, we will use "lazysizes". You can download it from the official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes).

2. Add the `data-src` attribute to the `<img>` tag and set it to the image's source URL. Remove the `src` attribute or leave it blank. For example:

```html
<img data-src="image.jpg" alt="Lazy Loaded Image" class="lazyload">
```

3. Include the "lazysizes" script in your HTML file. Place this script tag just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="path/to/lazysizes.min.js" async=""></script>
```

Replace `"path/to/lazysizes.min.js"` with the correct relative path to the `lazysizes.min.js` file in your project.

4. Add the "lazyload" class to the `<img>` tag. This class tells the lazy loading library to handle the image's loading behavior.

Now, when the user scrolls and the image is about to appear in the viewport, the lazy loading library will load the image.

 3: Testing Responsive Images

1. Open your HTML file in a web browser.

2. Inspect the page and use the browser's developer tools to simulate different screen sizes.

3. Verify that the appropriate image versions are loaded based on the screen size.

4. If you implemented lazy loading, scroll the page and ensure that images load as they come into the viewport.

1. **Choose a server-side technology**: Determine which server-side technology you will use to implement the server logic for emitting updates. WebSocket and server-sent events are supported in different programming languages and frameworks. Choose the one that best aligns with your project's requirements and familiarity.

2. **Set up the server**: Create a new file or modify an existing server file to handle the WebSocket or server-sent events functionality. This file will serve as your server-side implementation.

3. **Include the necessary dependencies**: If you're using a framework or library, include the required dependencies in your server-side code. This step may vary depending on the technology you choose. Refer to the official documentation or community resources for guidance on including the necessary packages.

4. **Establish a connection with the database**: Connect to your database using the appropriate library or driver for your chosen server-side technology. Set up the necessary configurations to enable monitoring for changes in the database.

5. **Implement change detection**: Set up a mechanism to detect changes in the database. Depending on your database technology, this may involve using triggers, change data capture (CDC), or other mechanisms provided by the database itself.

6. **Send updates to connected clients**: When changes are detected in the database, send updates to the clients connected through WebSocket or server-sent events.

   - For WebSocket:
     - Maintain a list of connected WebSocket clients.
     - When a change is detected in the database, iterate over the list of connected clients and send the updates to each client.

     ```javascript
     // Assuming you have a list of connected clients
     const connectedClients = [];

     // When a change occurs in the database
     const changeData = {
       // The updated data or relevant information about the change
     };

     // Iterate over the list of connected clients and send updates
     connectedClients.forEach((client) => {
       client.send(JSON.stringify(changeData));
     });
     ```

   - For server-sent events:
     - Maintain an open connection with each client through server-sent events.
     - When a change is detected in the database, send the updates to all open connections.

     ```javascript
     // Assuming you have a list of open connections
     const openConnections = [];

     // When a change occurs in the database
     const changeData = {
       // The updated data or relevant information about the change
     };

     // Iterate over the list of open connections and send updates
     openConnections.forEach((connection) => {
       connection.send(JSON.stringify(changeData));
     });
     ```

7. **Test the updates**: Verify that the server is emitting updates when changes occur in the database. Make changes in the database that should trigger updates and observe if the connected clients receive the updates in real-time.

   For example, if a new time slot becomes available or an existing time slot is removed, the server should emit the corresponding updates to the connected clients.

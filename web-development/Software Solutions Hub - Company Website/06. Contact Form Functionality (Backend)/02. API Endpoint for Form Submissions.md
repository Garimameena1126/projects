# Creating an API Endpoint for Handling Form Submissions

In this task, we will create an API endpoint using the Express framework to handle form submissions from the contact form on our website. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task:

## Step 1: Define the Route

1. Open the `server.js` file in your project directory.
2. Locate the section where you defined routes.
3. Add a new route to handle form submissions. For example, to handle POST requests to `/submit-form`, add the following code snippet:
    ```javascript
    app.post('/submit-form', (req, res) => {
      // Handle form submission logic
    });
    ```

## Step 2: Implement Form Submission Logic

1. Inside the route handler function, implement the logic to handle form submissions. This can include validating the data, storing it in a database, sending an email, or any other desired functionality.
2. Access the submitted form data using the `req.body` object. For example, if your form has fields named `name` and `email`, you can access their values as `req.body.name` and `req.body.email`.
3. Perform any necessary validation or data processing before storing or using the form data.
    
    **Example:** Storing Form Submissions in an Array
    
    ```javascript
    // Create an array to store form submissions
    const formSubmissions = [];
    
    app.post('/submit-form', (req, res) => {
      // Extract form data from the request body
      const { name, email } = req.body;
    
      // Validate the form data (e.g., check for required fields)
      if (!name || !email) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Name and email are required' });
      }
    
      // Store the form data in the array
      formSubmissions.push({ name, email });
    
      // Send a response indicating success
      res.status(200).json({ message: 'Form submission successful' });
    });
    ```

    In the example above, we store the form submissions in an array called `formSubmissions`. We extract the `name` and `email` fields from the request body and validate them to ensure they are not empty. If validation fails, we send a `400 Bad Request` response with an error message. If validation succeeds, we store the form data in the array and send a `200 OK` response with a success message.

## Step 3: Test the API Endpoint

1. Save the changes to `server.js`.
2. Start or restart your backend server if it's not already running.
3. Test the API endpoint using an API testing tool like Postman or by submitting the contact form on your website.
4. Send a POST request to the route you defined (`/submit-form`) with the necessary form data.
5. Check the response to ensure it matches the expected behavior. For example, if the form submission is successful, you should receive a `200 OK` response with a success message.

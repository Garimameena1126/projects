# Beginner's Guide: Setting up Real-Time Notifications using WebSockets

In this guide, we will learn how to set up a real-time notification mechanism using WebSockets. WebSockets allow bidirectional communication between a client (web browser) and a server, enabling real-time updates without the need for frequent polling. We will follow a step-by-step approach to implement this feature in our project.

## Step 1: Install Required Dependencies
To use WebSockets in our project, we need to install the necessary dependencies. Assuming you are using a JavaScript-based stack (such as Node.js), follow these steps:

1. Open your project directory in the terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to install the `websocket` package:
```shell
npm install websocket
```

This command will install the WebSocket library that we will use for our server-side implementation.

## Step 2: Set Up WebSocket Server
In this step, we will create a WebSocket server that will handle the real-time communication between the server and the clients.

1. Create a new file called `websocket-server.js` (or any other name you prefer) in your project's server-side directory.

2. In this file, import the necessary WebSocket library:
```javascript
const WebSocket = require('websocket').server;
```

3. Create an HTTP server instance (assuming you already have an HTTP server set up in your project):
```javascript
const httpServer = require('http').createServer();
```

4. Create a WebSocket server instance by passing the HTTP server to it:
```javascript
const wsServer = new WebSocket({ httpServer });
```

5. Set up event listeners for WebSocket connections:
```javascript
wsServer.on('request', function(request) {
  const connection = request.accept(null, request.origin);
  
  // Handle WebSocket connection events here
});
```

6. Within the WebSocket connection event listener, you can define logic to handle incoming WebSocket messages, manage connected clients, and send notifications to relevant users.

## Step 3: Handle WebSocket Events
Inside the WebSocket connection event listener, we need to define the logic to handle various WebSocket events, such as receiving messages and managing connected clients.

1. To handle incoming messages from clients, add the following code inside the WebSocket connection event listener:
```javascript
connection.on('message', function(message) {
  // Handle incoming WebSocket messages here
});
```

2. Implement the necessary logic to process the received message and determine the relevant action to be taken. For example, if a new review is posted, you may want to notify connected clients about it.

3. To manage connected clients, you can maintain a list of active connections and update it as clients connect or disconnect. Here's an example of how to keep track of connected clients:
```javascript
const connections = [];

// ...

wsServer.on('request', function(request) {
  const connection = request.accept(null, request.origin);
  
  // Add the new connection to the list
  connections.push(connection);

  // Handle WebSocket connection events here
  connection.on('close', function() {
    // Remove the closed connection from the list
    const index = connections.indexOf(connection);
    if (index !== -1) {
      connections.splice(index, 1);
    }
  });
});
```

## Step 4: Broadcast Notifications to Clients
To send notifications to connected clients, we can iterate over the list of active connections and send the notification to each client.

1. Identify the appropriate event or action in your project that triggers the need for a notification. For example, when a new review is posted, we want to notify relevant users.

2. When such an event occurs, iterate over the `connections` array and send the notification message to each client:
```javascript


const notification = {
  type: 'new-review',
  message: 'A new review has been posted!',
  // Additional notification data
};

connections.forEach(function(connection) {
  connection.send(JSON.stringify(notification));
});
```

Make sure to format the notification data according to your project's requirements.

## Step 5: Handle WebSocket Events on the Client-side
On the client-side, we need to establish a WebSocket connection and handle incoming messages from the server.

1. In your client-side code (e.g., JavaScript within your web page), establish a WebSocket connection to the server:
```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080'); // Replace with your server URL
```

2. Set up event listeners to handle WebSocket events, such as receiving messages:
```javascript
socket.onmessage = function(event) {
  const notification = JSON.parse(event.data);
  
  // Handle incoming WebSocket messages here
};
```

3. Implement the necessary logic to handle incoming notifications and update the user interface accordingly. For example, you can display a notification pop-up or update a notification counter.

## Evaluation of Trained Model's Performance

In this guide, we will focus on evaluating the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics will help us assess how well the model predicts calorie intake compared to the actual values.

### Step 1: Prepare the Test Data

Before we can evaluate the model, we need to prepare the test data. The test data will be used to assess the model's performance on unseen examples. We'll split our preprocessed data into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the model and the testing set used for evaluation.

```python
# Assuming you have already preprocessed and split the data into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 2: Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a commonly used metric to evaluate regression models. It measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the true values.

```python
# Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", mae)
```

The MAE value represents the average absolute deviation of the predicted calorie intake from the true calorie intake. Smaller MAE values indicate better performance, where a value of 0 would indicate a perfect prediction.

### Step 3: Calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is another widely used metric for evaluating regression models. It calculates the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted values and the true values.

```python
# Calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):", rmse)
```

The RMSE value provides an estimate of the average prediction error, taking into account both the bias and variance of the model. Like MAE, smaller RMSE values indicate better performance, and a value of 0 would represent a perfect prediction.

### Step 4: Analyze the Model's Predictions

To gain further insights into the model's performance, it's helpful to analyze the predicted values alongside the actual values. This analysis can provide a visual understanding of how well the model is predicting calorie intake.

```python
# Compare model's predictions with actual values
comparison = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred.flatten()})
print(comparison.head(10))
```

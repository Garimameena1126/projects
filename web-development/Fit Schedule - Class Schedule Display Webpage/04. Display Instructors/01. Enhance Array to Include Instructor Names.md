#### Task: Enhance the existing array of class names and timings to include associated instructor names.

1. Open your JavaScript file, "script.js," in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Locate the existing array variable that stores the class names and timings. For example:

```javascript
// Existing array of class names and timings
let classSchedule = [
    { name: 'Yoga', time: '9:00 AM - 10:00 AM' },
    { name: 'Pilates', time: '10:30 AM - 11:30 AM' },
    { name: 'Zumba', time: '12:00 PM - 1:00 PM' }
];
```

3. Modify the existing array to include associated instructor names. Add an "instructor" property to each class object. For example:

```javascript
// Enhanced array with instructor names
let classSchedule = [
    { name: 'Yoga', time: '9:00 AM - 10:00 AM', instructor: 'John Doe' },
    { name: 'Pilates', time: '10:30 AM - 11:30 AM', instructor: 'Jane Smith' },
    { name: 'Zumba', time: '12:00 PM - 1:00 PM', instructor: 'Mike Johnson' }
];
```

4. Save the changes to your JavaScript file.

Explanation:
- The existing array, `classSchedule`, stores class names and timings as objects.
- Each object in the array represents a class and has the properties `name` and `time`.
- To enhance the array with instructor names, a new property called `instructor` is added to each class object.
- The `instructor` property holds the associated instructor's name as a string.

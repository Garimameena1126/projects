In this task, we will focus on handling errors and edge cases that may occur when interacting with the third-party API. By implementing proper error handling mechanisms, we can ensure our application behaves gracefully and provides a good user experience. Follow the steps below to accomplish this.

1. Identify Potential Errors and Edge Cases
   - Study the API documentation provided by the third-party API provider.
   - Identify potential error scenarios and edge cases that could occur during API interactions.
   - Examples of common errors and edge cases include invalid API keys, rate limits, server errors, empty responses, and unexpected response formats.

2. Use Proper Error Handling Techniques
   - Determine the appropriate error handling techniques based on your programming language and framework.
   - Common techniques include try-catch blocks, error callbacks, promise rejections, or error middleware depending on the language and framework you are using.
   - Ensure that the error handling mechanism you choose aligns with the programming paradigm and best practices of your chosen technology stack.

3. Implement Error Handling Logic
   - Update your API integration code to include error handling logic.
   - Place API requests within appropriate error handling constructs to catch and handle potential errors and edge cases.
   - Depending on the error scenario, you may need to retry the request, show error messages to the user, or log the error for debugging purposes.

4. Display User-Friendly Error Messages
   - Create user-friendly error messages to inform the user about any errors encountered during API interactions.
   - Consider the different types of errors that may occur and provide relevant and clear error messages.
   - Display these error messages within your UI to help users understand and troubleshoot any issues.

   Example (JavaScript with Fetch API):
   ```javascript
   async function fetchTravelPackages() {
     try {
       const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/travel-packages');
   
       if (!response.ok) {
         throw new Error('Failed to fetch travel packages. Please try again later.');
       }
   
       const data = await response.json();
       return data;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error fetching travel packages:', error);
       throw error; // Rethrow the error to be caught by the caller
     }
   }
   ```

5. Implement Retry Mechanisms (if applicable)
   - For certain types of errors, such as network issues or rate limits, you may want to implement retry mechanisms to handle transient errors.
   - Determine the appropriate strategy for retries, such as exponential backoff or fixed intervals.
   - Implement retry logic to automatically retry failed API requests after a certain delay or based on predefined conditions.

6. Handle Edge Cases
   - Consider edge cases where the API response may not match the expected format or contain incomplete data.
   - Implement additional validation and data parsing logic to handle these edge cases.
   - Use conditional statements or data transformation techniques to extract and handle relevant data while ignoring invalid or unexpected data.

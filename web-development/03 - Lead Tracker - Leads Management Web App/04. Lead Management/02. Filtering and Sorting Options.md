To implement filtering and sorting options for the lead list, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Identify the Filter and Sort Criteria

Decide on the filter and sort criteria you want to provide to users. This could include options such as filtering by name or email, and sorting by name, email, or date added. Determine the input method for these criteria, such as dropdown menus, input fields, or checkboxes.

#### Step 2: Update the Database Query

Modify the database query used to retrieve leads to incorporate the filtering and sorting options. You will need to dynamically generate the query based on the selected criteria.

For example, if the user selects to filter by name and sort by email, you would update the query to include the WHERE clause for name filtering and the ORDER BY clause for email sorting.

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, phone FROM leads WHERE name = 'John Doe' ORDER BY email ASC;
```

Customize the query based on the selected criteria and the structure of your database.

#### Step 3: Capture User Input

In your application's user interface, capture the user's selected filter and sort criteria. This can be done through form submission, AJAX requests, or any other interaction method appropriate for your application.

Ensure that you retrieve and store the selected criteria in variables that you can use in the next step.

#### Step 4: Modify the Query with User Input

Using the user input captured in the previous step, update the database query dynamically. Inject the filter and sort criteria into the query before executing it.

Be cautious of SQL injection vulnerabilities when incorporating user input into your query. Sanitize and validate the user input or consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to mitigate these risks.

#### Step 5: Execute the Modified Query

With the updated query, execute it against the database to retrieve the filtered and sorted leads.

Refer to the documentation or appropriate guides for your chosen database driver or library to learn how to execute the modified query with user input.

#### Step 6: Display Filtered and Sorted Leads

Present the retrieved filtered and sorted leads to the user in the desired format, such as a table or a list. Use the same method as explained in the previous guide to display the leads based on your chosen programming language, framework, and template engine.

#### Step 7: Integrate with Your Application

Integrate the filtering and sorting functionality into your application's views or templates. Modify the necessary code to handle the user input and execute the modified query.

Depending on your programming language or framework, this step may involve updating the existing view functions, adding new routes or endpoints, or enhancing existing AJAX endpoints.

#### Step 8: Test and Verify

Test your application and interact with the filtering and sorting options to ensure they work as expected. Verify that the leads are filtered and sorted correctly based on the selected criteria.

Make any necessary adjustments to the user interface or integration code if the filtering or sorting behavior is not as desired.

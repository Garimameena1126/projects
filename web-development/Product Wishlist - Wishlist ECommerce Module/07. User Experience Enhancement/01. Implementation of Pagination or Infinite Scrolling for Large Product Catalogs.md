1. Open the JavaScript file associated with your project.

2. Determine the number of products to display per page. This will help you decide how to divide your product catalog into smaller sections.

   ```javascript
   const productsPerPage = 10;
   ```

   In this example, we set the `productsPerPage` value to 10. Adjust this number based on your specific needs.

3. Calculate the total number of pages based on the number of products and products per page.

   ```javascript
   const totalProducts = products.length;
   const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalProducts / productsPerPage);
   ```

   In the code above, we assume that you have an array called `products` that contains all the products in your catalog. By dividing the total number of products by the products per page and using the `Math.ceil()` function, we determine the total number of pages needed to display all the products.

4. Create a function to display the products for a specific page.

   ```javascript
   function displayProducts(pageNumber) {
     const startIndex = (pageNumber - 1) * productsPerPage;
     const endIndex = startIndex + productsPerPage;
     const productsToShow = products.slice(startIndex, endIndex);

     // Display the products on the page
     productsToShow.forEach((product) => {
       // Render the product on the page
     });
   }
   ```

   The `displayProducts` function takes a `pageNumber` as input and calculates the start and end indices for the products to be displayed on that page. It then slices the `products` array to extract the products for that page and renders them on the page.

5. Add navigation controls to allow users to switch between pages.

   ```javascript
   const previousButton = document.querySelector('.previous-button');
   const nextButton = document.querySelector('.next-button');
   let currentPage = 1;

   previousButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
     if (currentPage > 1) {
       currentPage--;
       displayProducts(currentPage);
     }
   });

   nextButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
     if (currentPage < totalPages) {
       currentPage++;
       displayProducts(currentPage);
     }
   });
   ```

   In the code above, we assume that you have previous and next buttons with classes `.previous-button` and `.next-button`, respectively. We also initialize a `currentPage` variable to keep track of the current page being displayed. When the previous button is clicked, the `currentPage` is decremented if it's greater than 1, and the `displayProducts` function is called with the updated page number. Similarly, when the next button is clicked, the `currentPage` is incremented if it's less than the total number of pages, and the `displayProducts` function is called.

6. Test your application by navigating through the pages and verifying that the appropriate products are displayed for each page.

7. Make further adjustments to the code and functionality as needed based on your project's requirements.

## Storing the New Activity in the Respective Itinerary Object

In this guide, we will implement the functionality to store the new activity in the respective itinerary object. This will ensure that the activity is associated with the correct itinerary and can be displayed correctly.

### Step 1: Retrieve the Selected Itinerary

1. Identify the method or event handler responsible for capturing the selected itinerary. This could be a click event on a specific itinerary or any other interaction mechanism.
2. Retrieve the selected itinerary object based on the user's selection.

For example, if you have a list of itineraries displayed and the user clicks on a specific itinerary, you can retrieve the selected itinerary object using its unique identifier.

```javascript
const selectedItinerary = itineraries.find((itinerary) => itinerary.id === selectedItineraryId);
```

In the above code, `itineraries` is an array that contains all the existing itineraries, and `selectedItineraryId` is the unique identifier of the selected itinerary.

### Step 2: Capture Activity Details

1. Identify the method or event handler responsible for capturing the activity details. This could be a form submission, a button click, or any other interaction mechanism.
2. Retrieve the activity details from the user input fields or form.

For example, if you have an activity form with input fields for activity name, location, and time, you can retrieve the values using JavaScript.

```javascript
const activityName = document.getElementById('activity-name').value;
const activityLocation = document.getElementById('activity-location').value;
const activityTime = document.getElementById('activity-time').value;
```

In the above code, we assume that the input fields have corresponding IDs (`activity-name`, `activity-location`, `activity-time`).

### Step 3: Create the New Activity Object

1. Using the captured activity details, create a new activity object.
2. Include any necessary properties to store the activity information, such as `name`, `location`, and `time`.

```javascript
const newActivity = {
  name: activityName,
  location: activityLocation,
  time: activityTime,
};
```

In the above code, we create a new object `newActivity` with properties corresponding to the captured activity details.

### Step 4: Add the New Activity to the Itinerary

1. Access the selected itinerary object.
2. Add the new activity object to the itinerary's list of activities.

```javascript
selectedItinerary.activities.push(newActivity);
```

In the above code, we assume that the selected itinerary object has a property named `activities`, which is an array storing all the activities associated with that itinerary. We push the `newActivity` object to the `activities` array.

### Step 5: Test the Functionality

1. Save your JavaScript file.
2. Trigger the necessary events or interactions that capture the selected itinerary and activity details.
3. Verify that the new activity is correctly stored in the respective itinerary object by inspecting the itinerary's `activities` array.

For example, you can log the itinerary object to the console:

```javascript
console.log(selectedItinerary);
```

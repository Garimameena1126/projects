1. Open your text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. In your project directory (where your backend server is set up), create a new directory called `routes`. This directory will contain your route files.

3. Inside the `routes` directory, create a new file called `formRoutes.js`. This file will contain the route handlers for form submissions.

4. Open the `formRoutes.js` file and import the necessary modules at the top:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();
   ```

5. Define a route handler for handling form submissions. For example, to handle a POST request to `/submit-form`, you can write the following code:

   ```javascript
   router.post('/submit-form', (req, res) => {
     // Handle form submission logic here
   });
   ```

   Replace `/submit-form` with the desired URL path for your form submission route.

6. Inside the route handler, you can access the form data sent by the client using the `req.body` object. Make sure to install and configure the necessary middleware for parsing the request body. For example, if you're using the `body-parser` middleware, you can write the following code:

   ```javascript
   const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
   router.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
   ```

   This code enables the parsing of URL-encoded form data and makes it accessible via `req.body`.

7. Implement the logic to handle the form submission. This can include validation, processing the data, and storing it in a database. Here's an example of how you can access the form data and send a response:

   ```javascript
   router.post('/submit-form', (req, res) => {
     const { name, email, message } = req.body;

     // Validate form inputs
     if (!name || !email || !message) {
       return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Please fill in all fields' });
     }

     // Process the form data
     // ...

     // Store the data in a database
     // ...

     // Send a response
     return res.status(200).json({ message: 'Form submitted successfully' });
   });
   ```

   Modify the logic according to your specific requirements. You can use different form validation techniques, process the form data as needed, and store it in your preferred database.

8. Export the router at the end of the file:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = router;
   ```

9. Save the changes to the `formRoutes.js` file.

10. Open the `server.js` file (where you set up your backend server) and import the `formRoutes.js` file at the top:

    ```javascript
    const formRoutes = require('./routes/formRoutes');
    ```

11. Register the form routes by adding the following code after creating the Express application instance:

    ```javascript
    app.use('/api', formRoutes);
    ```

    Replace `/api` with the desired base URL path for your API endpoints.

12. Save the changes to the `server.js` file.

13. Restart your backend server if it's already running.

14. Your route to handle form submissions is now ready. You can test it by submitting a form from your frontend application to the appropriate URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/submit-form`). Verify that the form data is properly received and processed, and the appropriate response is sent back.

#  Creating a Login Form for Existing Members

In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating a login form for existing members to access their accounts in the fitness class booking system. The login form will allow users to enter their credentials and authenticate themselves. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to implement this feature.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have completed the following steps:
- Set up a user registration form with validation, as mentioned in the previous guide.

## Step 1: Create the Login Form HTML Markup
1. Open your project folder in a text editor.
2. Locate the HTML file where you want to include the login form. For example, if you have a file named `login.html`, open it for editing.
3. Add the following HTML code to create the login form:
   ```html
   <form action="/login" method="POST">
     <div>
       <label for="email">Email:</label>
       <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
     </div>
     <div>
       <label for="password">Password:</label>
       <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
     </div>
     <div>
       <button type="submit">Log In</button>
     </div>
   </form>
   ```
   This code defines an HTML form with two input fields: one for the email and another for the password. The form has a submit button to trigger the login process.

4. Save the changes to your HTML file.

## Step 2: Implement the Login Route and Logic
1. Open the server-side file responsible for handling routes. For example, if you are using Node.js with Express, open the file where your routes are defined (e.g., `app.js` or a separate routes file).
2. Add the following code to define the login route and handle the login form submission:
   ```javascript
   app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
     const { email, password } = req.body;
     
     // Implement your authentication logic here
     // For example, check if the provided credentials are valid
     
     if (validCredentials) {
       // Redirect the user to the dashboard or desired page upon successful login
       res.redirect('/dashboard');
     } else {
       // Render the login form with an error message if the credentials are invalid
       res.render('login', { error: 'Invalid email or password' });
     }
   });
   ```
   Replace `/dashboard` with the appropriate route to redirect users to the desired page after successful login.

3. Save the changes to your server-side file.

## Step 3: Test the Login Form
1. Start your web server by running the appropriate command. For example, if you are using Node.js with Express, run `node app.js` or `npm start`.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to the login page of your fitness class booking system.
3. Fill in the email and password fields with valid or invalid credentials.
4. Click the "Log In" button to submit the form.
5. Observe the behavior based on the provided credentials:
   - If the credentials are valid, the user should be redirected to the dashboard or the designated page.
   - If the credentials are invalid, the login form should be rendered again with an error message indicating the issue.

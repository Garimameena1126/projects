# Creating a User Registration Page and Enabling User Login and Logout

In this task, we will create a user registration page and enable user login and logout functionality in our inventory management system. The user registration page will allow new users to create an account, while the login and logout functionality will authenticate users and manage their session state.

## Step 1: Design the User Registration Page

1. Design the user registration page with appropriate form fields to collect user information, such as username, email, and password.

2. Use HTML and CSS to create the form layout and style it according to your application's design.

Example:
```html
<!-- registration.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>User Registration</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>User Registration</h1>
  <form action="/register" method="POST">
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>

    <button type="submit">Register</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 2: Handle User Registration

1. Set up a route in your backend application to handle the user registration form submission.

2. Retrieve the submitted form data from the request parameters.

3. Validate the user input to ensure it meets any required criteria, such as a unique username or a strong password.

4. If the validation is successful, create a new user record in your database with the provided information.

Example (using Express.js and MongoDB):
```javascript
// Assuming you have a route for user registration
app.post('/register', (req, res) => {
  const { username, email, password } = req.body;

  // Validate the user input
  // ...

  // Create a new user in the database
  const newUser = new User({ username, email, password });
  newUser.save();

  res.redirect('/login');
});
```

## Step 3: Design the User Login Page

1. Design the user login page with appropriate form fields to collect the user's credentials, such as username/email and password.

2. Use HTML and CSS to create the form layout and style it according to your application's design.

Example:
```html
<!-- login.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>User Login</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>User Login</h1>
  <form action="/login" method="POST">
    <label for="username">Username/Email:</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>

    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>

    <button type="submit">Login</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 4: Handle User Login

1. Set up a route in your backend application to handle the user login form submission.

2. Retrieve the submitted form data from the request parameters.

3. Validate the user's credentials against the stored user records in your database.

4. If the credentials are valid, create a session for the user to maintain their authenticated state.

Example (using Express.js and Passport.js):
```javascript


// Assuming you have configured Passport.js for authentication
app.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/login' }), (req, res) => {
  // Redirect the user to the authenticated home page
  res.redirect('/home');
});
```

## Step 5: Enable User Logout

1. Set up a route in your backend application to handle user logout.

2. Destroy the user's session to log them out and remove their authentication state.

Example (using Express.js and Passport.js):
```javascript
app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.logout(); // Passport.js method to remove session data
  res.redirect('/login');
});
```

## Step 6: Test and Iterate

1. Test the user registration page by submitting registration forms with valid and invalid input. Ensure that new user records are created successfully.

2. Test the user login functionality by submitting login forms with valid and invalid credentials. Verify that users are redirected to the appropriate pages based on their authentication status.

3. Test the user logout functionality by logging out and verifying that the user's session is destroyed.

4. Iterate and make any necessary improvements or bug fixes based on your testing results.

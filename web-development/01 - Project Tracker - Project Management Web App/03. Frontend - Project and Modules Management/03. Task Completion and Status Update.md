In this guide, we will enhance our project management app by adding JavaScript functionality to mark tasks as completed and update their status visually on the web page.

### Step 1: Set up the HTML Structure

Ensure you have already created the static HTML page to display the list of existing projects and tasks, as outlined in the previous guides. Make sure the necessary HTML elements, such as `<ul>`, `<li>`, and appropriate classes or identifiers, are in place.

### Step 2: Add JavaScript to the HTML Page

Inside the `<script>` tag in your HTML file, add the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Function to handle task completion
function toggleTaskCompletion(event) {
  const taskElement = event.target;
  
  // Toggle the 'completed' class on the task element
  taskElement.classList.toggle('completed');
}

// Attach the event listener to the task list
const taskList = document.getElementById('taskList');
taskList.addEventListener('click', toggleTaskCompletion);
```

### Step 3: Define CSS Styles for Completed Tasks

In your CSS file or in a `<style>` tag within the HTML file, add the necessary styles to visually differentiate completed tasks. For example:

```css
.completed {
  text-decoration: line-through;
  color: gray;
}
```

### Step 4: Test the Functionality

Save the HTML and CSS files, then open the HTML file in a web browser. You should see the list of existing projects and tasks. Click on a task to mark it as completed.

Upon clicking, the JavaScript code will execute and toggle the 'completed' class on the task element. As a result, the task's appearance will change based on the defined CSS styles, indicating its completion status.

### Step 5: Customize the Functionality

You can customize the JavaScript code and CSS styles to match your desired functionality and visual representation of completed tasks. For instance, you can add additional behavior such as updating a task's status in the database or displaying a checkmark icon when a task is completed.

In this task, we will set up the project repository and version control system to track the changes made to the project files and collaborate with other developers effectively. We'll be using Git as our version control system and GitHub as our remote repository hosting service. Follow the steps below to complete this task:

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com) and log in to your account. If you don't have an account, sign up for a new one.
2. Once logged in, click on the "+" sign in the top-right corner of the page and select "New repository" from the dropdown menu.
3. On the "Create a new repository" page, provide a name for your repository (e.g., "software-development-website") and an optional description.
4. Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private, based on your requirements.
5. Leave the other options as default and click on the "Create repository" button to create the new repository.

## Step 2: Set Up Git Locally

1. Download and install Git on your local machine by following the instructions for your operating system. You can find the official Git downloads at https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and verify the installation by running the following command:
   ```shell
   git --version
   ```
   It should display the installed version of Git.

## Step 3: Clone the Repository

1. On the GitHub repository page you created earlier, click on the green "Code" button and copy the URL provided.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to store your project, and run the following command:
   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied from GitHub. This command will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

## Step 4: Initialize Git in the Project Directory

1. Change into the project directory by running the following command:
   ```shell
   cd software-development-website
   ```
   Replace `software-development-website` with the actual name of your project directory.
2. Run the following command to initialize Git in the project directory:
   ```shell
   git init
   ```
   This will create a new Git repository in the project directory.

## Step 5: Connect Local Repository to the Remote Repository

1. Go back to the GitHub repository page and copy the remote repository's URL.
2. In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command to add the remote repository:
   ```shell
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied from GitHub. This command will connect your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.

## Step 6: Verify the Configuration

1. To verify that the remote repository is set up correctly, run the following command:
   ```shell
   git remote -v
   ```
   It should display the remote repository's URL.

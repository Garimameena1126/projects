**Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets**

In this task, we will focus on splitting the preprocessed data into training and testing sets. This step is crucial for building and evaluating our machine learning model. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.

**Step 1: Import Libraries**

Before we begin, let's import the necessary libraries for this task. We will need the `numpy` and `pandas` libraries for data manipulation and the `sklearn` library for splitting the data.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

**Step 2: Load Preprocessed Data**

Assuming that you have already preprocessed the data as part of Module 2, we will start by loading the preprocessed data into a DataFrame. Ensure that your preprocessed data is in a format compatible with the pandas library.

```python
# Load the preprocessed data into a DataFrame
preprocessed_data = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_data.csv')
```

**Step 3: Splitting the Data**

Next, we will split the data into training and testing sets. Typically, the data is split into a 70:30 or 80:20 ratio, where 70% or 80% of the data is used for training and the remaining portion is used for testing. We will use the `train_test_split` function from the sklearn library for this purpose.

```python
# Separate the features and target variable
X = preprocessed_data.drop('sleep_quality', axis=1)
y = preprocessed_data['sleep_quality']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

In the above code, we first assign the features to the variable `X` by dropping the target variable ('sleep_quality') from the DataFrame. The target variable is assigned to the variable `y`. Then, we use the `train_test_split` function to split the data into training and testing sets. Here, `test_size=0.3` indicates that 30% of the data will be allocated for testing, and `random_state=42` sets a random seed to ensure reproducibility.

**Step 4: Understanding the Split Data**

Let's print the shapes of the training and testing sets to verify if the data has been split correctly.

```python
# Print the shapes of the training and testing sets
print("Training Set - X:", X_train.shape, "y:", y_train.shape)
print("Testing Set - X:", X_test.shape, "y:", y_test.shape)
```

This will give you an output similar to the following:

```
Training Set - X: (700, 10) y: (700,)
Testing Set - X: (300, 10) y: (300,)
```

The output shows that the training set has 700 samples and the testing set has 300 samples. The number of columns (features) in both sets should match.

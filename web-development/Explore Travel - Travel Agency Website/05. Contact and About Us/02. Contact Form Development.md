# Beginner's Guide: Including Agency Contact Information

In this guide, we will add the agency's contact information, including email, phone number, and address, to the contact page. Let's proceed with the following steps:

## Step 1: Open the Contact Page HTML File

1. Open the `contact.html` file in your code editor.

2. Locate the `<section id="contact-info">` section in the HTML code.

## Step 2: Add Contact Information

1. Inside the `<section id="contact-info">` section, add the contact information in the appropriate HTML elements. For example:

```html
<section id="contact-info">
  <h2>Contact Information</h2>

  <p>Email: info@example.com</p>
  <p>Phone: +1 123-456-7890</p>
  <p>Address: 123 Main Street, City, Country</p>
</section>
```

2. Customize the contact information to match your agency's actual details.

## Step 3: Style the Contact Information (Optional)

1. Open the `styles.css` file in your code editor.

2. Add CSS rules to style the contact information section. For example:

```css
/* styles.css */

#contact-info {
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}

#contact-info h2 {
  margin-top: 0;
}
```

3. Customize the styles to match your project's design and branding.

## Step 4: Test the Contact Page

1. Save the changes made to the `contact.html` and `styles.css` files.

2. Open the `contact.html` file in your web browser.

3. Verify that the contact page is displayed correctly with the added contact information.

4. Confirm that the contact information appears as intended, including the email, phone number, and address.

In this task, we will explore various techniques to optimize the performance of our sentiment analysis model. By implementing these techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy and overall effectiveness of the model. We will focus on feature extraction methods and ensemble learning techniques. Let's dive into the step-by-step guide to explore these optimization techniques.

## Step 1: Load the Dataset

Before we proceed with optimizing the model, let's load the preprocessed dataset that we created in Module 2. Ensure that you have the preprocessed dataset file available.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the preprocessed dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_dataset.csv')

# Separate the feature (text) and target (sentiment labels)
X = dataset['text']
y = dataset['sentiment']
```

## Step 2: Feature Extraction with Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic and contextual information. They can enhance the performance of our sentiment analysis model by providing richer word representations. We will use pre-trained word embeddings to extract features from our text data.

1. Download a pre-trained word embedding model (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) suitable for sentiment analysis. You can find these models on the internet or use libraries such as `gensim` or `spaCy` to load pre-trained word vectors.

2. Load the pre-trained word embedding model and convert each text sample into a fixed-length vector representation using word embeddings.

   ```python
   from gensim.models import Word2Vec
   
   # Load the pre-trained word embedding model
   word2vec_model = Word2Vec.load('path_to_word2vec_model')
   
   # Convert text samples to word embeddings
   X_embeddings = []
   for text in X:
       # Tokenize the text into individual words
       words = text.split()
       # Get the word embeddings for each word in the text
       embeddings = [word2vec_model[word] for word in words if word in word2vec_model]
       # Calculate the average embedding for the text
       average_embedding = sum(embeddings) / len(embeddings)
       X_embeddings.append(average_embedding)
   ```

   Note: Adjust the code based on the specific word embedding model and library you are using.

3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   
   # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_embeddings, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

## Step 3: Ensemble Learning with Voting Classifiers

Ensemble learning involves combining multiple models to make predictions. We will use the concept of voting classifiers to combine the predictions of multiple sentiment analysis models. This ensemble technique can improve the overall accuracy and robustness of our sentiment analysis system.

1. Select a few classification algorithms suitable for sentiment analysis. For example, you can choose Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

2. Train each individual model using the preprocessed training dataset.

   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   from sklearn.svm import SVC
   from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
   from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
   
   # Create individual sentiment analysis models
   rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
   svm_model = SVC()
   nb_model = MultinomialNB()
   
   # Train each individual model
   rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   svm_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   nb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

3. Create a voting classifier by combining the individual models.

   ```python
   # Create a voting classifier
   voting_classifier = VotingClassifier(
       estimators=[('rf', rf_model), ('svm', svm_model), ('nb', nb_model)],
       voting='hard'
   )
   
   # Train the voting classifier
   voting_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

4. Evaluate the performance of the voting classifier on the testing dataset.

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
   
   # Make predictions on the testing set
   y_pred = voting_classifier.predict(X_test)
   
   # Calculate accuracy
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
   print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
   
   # Generate a classification report
   report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
   print("Classification Report:\n", report)
   ```

## Step 4: Model Performance Comparison

Compare the performance of the sentiment analysis models using different feature extraction techniques and ensemble learning.

- Calculate and compare the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of each individual model (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes) using the word embedding features.

- Calculate and compare the performance metrics of the voting classifier using the word embedding features.

- Document the results and analyze the impact of different techniques on the model's performance.

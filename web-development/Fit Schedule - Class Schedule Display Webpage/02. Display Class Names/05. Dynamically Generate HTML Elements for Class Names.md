
## Use JavaScript to dynamically generate HTML elements for each class name in the array and append them to the container element.

1. Open your code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) where you have the project files.
2. Create a new JavaScript file named "script.js" in the same directory as your HTML file.
3. Link the JavaScript file to your HTML file by adding the following code inside the `<head>` section of "index.html":
    
    ```html
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    ```
    
    Explanation:
    - The `<script>` tag is used to embed or reference external JavaScript files in an HTML document.
    - The `src` attribute specifies the source file, which in this case is "script.js".

4. Switch to the "script.js" file and start by declaring an array variable to store the class names. Add the following code:

    ```javascript
    const classNames = ["Yoga", "Zumba", "Pilates", "Kickboxing"];
    ```
    
    Explanation:
    - We declare an array variable named `classNames` using the `const` keyword.
    - The array contains a few sample class names as strings.

5. Now, let's access the container element in the HTML file using JavaScript. In "script.js", add the following code:

    ```javascript
    const container = document.querySelector(".container");
    ```
    
    Explanation:
    - We use the `document.querySelector()` method to select an HTML element with the class name "container".
    - The selected element is then stored in the `container` variable for further use.

6. Next, we'll use JavaScript to dynamically generate HTML elements for each class name in the array and append them to the container element. Add the following code:

    ```javascript
    classNames.forEach(className => {
      const heading = document.createElement("h2");
      heading.textContent = className;
      container.appendChild(heading);
    });
    ```
    
    Explanation:
    - We use the `forEach()` method to iterate over each class name in the `classNames` array.
    - Inside the iteration, we create a new `<h2>` element using the `document.createElement()` method.
    - We set the text content of the `<h2>` element to the current class name using the `textContent` property.
    - Finally, we append the newly created `<h2>` element to the container element using the `appendChild()` method.

7. Save both "index.html" and "script.js" files.

# Adding a Header Section with a Catchy Title and Description

In this guide, we will focus on adding a header section to our Travel Agency website. The header section will include a catchy title and a description that will grab the attention of the users. This task is part of "Module 1: Setup and Basic Layout" of the project.

## Step 1: Open the HTML File
1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor of your choice. This file is located inside the `pages` folder of your project.

## Step 2: Add the Header Section
1. Inside the `<body>` tags of the `index.html` file, locate the opening and closing `<header>` tags. If they don't exist, add them at an appropriate location within the `<body>` tags.

2. Add the following code inside the `<header>` tags to create the header section:

```html
<section class="hero">
    <h1>Welcome to Travel Agency</h1>
    <p>Discover Your Dream Destinations</p>
</section>
```

Let's break down the code:

- `<section class="hero">`: This creates a `<section>` element with the class "hero". You can customize the class name if desired.
- `<h1>Welcome to Travel Agency</h1>`: This adds a level-one heading (`<h1>`) with the catchy title. Modify the title to suit your website's branding and style.
- `<p>Discover Your Dream Destinations</p>`: This adds a paragraph (`<p>`) with a description that entices users to explore the website further. Customize the description as needed.

## Step 3: Style the Header Section
1. To style the header section, you can add CSS code to the `style.css` file located in the `css` folder of your project. If the file doesn't exist, create it inside the `css` folder.

2. Open the `style.css` file in a text editor and add the following code:

```css
/* Style the header section */
section.hero {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  padding: 50px;
  text-align: center;
}

section.hero h1 {
  font-size: 36px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

section.hero p {
  font-size: 20px;
  color: #666;
}
```

The code above provides some basic styling for the header section. It sets the background color to `#f2f2f2` (light gray), adds some padding for spacing, and centers the content within the section. The font size and color of the title and description are also customized.

## Step 4: Save the Changes and Review
1. Save the changes made to the `index.html` and `style.css` files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to review the header section with the catchy title and description.

In this task, we will design and implement API integration endpoints that allow us to fetch real-time travel package data from the selected travel API provider. Follow the steps below to accomplish this.

1. Identify the Required Data
   - Determine the specific travel package data you want to fetch from the API provider.
   - Examples of data could include flight availability, hotel options, attractions, or any other relevant information.
   - Make a note of the required data fields and their corresponding endpoints in the API provider's documentation.

2. Choose an HTTP Client Library
   - Select an appropriate HTTP client library for your programming language to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
   - Popular options include `axios` for JavaScript, `requests` for Python, or `HttpClient` for C#.
   - Install the chosen library by following its installation instructions.

3. Set Up API Endpoint Constants
   - Define constants in your code to store the base URL and endpoints for the travel API.
   - For example, you might have a constant like `API_BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com"` and `ENDPOINT_PACKAGES = "/packages"`.
   - These constants will be used to construct the full URLs for making API requests.

4. Implement the API Request Function
   - Create a function that encapsulates the API request logic.
   - This function should utilize the HTTP client library to make GET requests to the API endpoints.
   - Construct the full URL by combining the base URL and the specific endpoint constant.
   - Add any necessary query parameters to the URL, such as filters or authentication credentials.
   - Handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the request process.

   Example (JavaScript):
   ```javascript
   const axios = require('axios');
   
   async function fetchTravelPackages() {
     const url = API_BASE_URL + ENDPOINT_PACKAGES;
   
     try {
       const response = await axios.get(url);
       return response.data;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error fetching travel packages:', error.message);
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

5. Extract and Process the Response Data
   - Once the API response is received, extract the relevant data from the response object.
   - Refer to the API provider's documentation to understand the structure of the response data.
   - Depending on the format of the data (e.g., JSON, XML), use appropriate methods to parse and extract the required information.

6. Integrate with the User Interface (UI)
   - Depending on your project's requirements, update the UI components to display the fetched travel package data.
   - Use the extracted data from the API response to populate the UI elements.
   - You can use frameworks or libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to render and manipulate the UI components.

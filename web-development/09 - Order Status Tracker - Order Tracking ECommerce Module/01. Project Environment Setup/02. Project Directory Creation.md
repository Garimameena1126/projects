# Creating a New Project Directory

In this task, we will create a new project directory where we will store all the files related to our Order Tracking and Status Updates feature. Follow the steps below to create the project directory.

## Step 1: Choose a Location

Choose a suitable location on your computer where you want to create the project directory. This could be anywhere you prefer, such as your desktop, a dedicated projects folder, or any other location that is easily accessible to you.

## Step 2: Open the Command Prompt or Terminal

Open the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) on your computer. This is the command line interface where you can run commands to perform various tasks.

## Step 3: Navigate to the Chosen Location

Navigate to the location where you want to create the project directory using the `cd` (change directory) command. For example, if you want to create the project directory on your desktop, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd Desktop
```

## Step 4: Create the Project Directory

To create the project directory, use the `mkdir` (make directory) command followed by the desired name of the directory. Choose a descriptive name that represents your project. For example, we will name our project directory "order-tracking-system".

```bash
mkdir order-tracking-system
```

## Step 5: Verify the Project Directory

You can verify that the project directory has been successfully created by listing the contents of the current directory using the `ls` command (on macOS/Linux) or the `dir` command (on Windows). You should see the newly created project directory listed among the files and folders.

```bash
ls
```

or

```bash
dir
```

## Step 6: Navigate into the Project Directory

To navigate into the project directory, use the `cd` command followed by the name of the project directory.

```bash
cd order-tracking-system
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new project directory for your Order Tracking and Status Updates feature.

> **Note**: It is good practice to choose meaningful names for your project directories that reflect their purpose. This helps you and others easily identify and understand the contents of the directory.

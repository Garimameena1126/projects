# Setting up a Local Development Environment

To begin building the Order Tracking and Status Updates feature for ecommerce websites, you need to set up a local development environment on your computer. This involves installing the necessary software, such as Node.js and a code editor, and configuring them properly. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your local development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your computer:

- **Node.js**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It also includes the npm package manager, which is used to install and manage dependencies. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Install the LTS (Long-Term Support) version.

- **A Code Editor**: Choose a code editor that you're comfortable with. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. Download and install your preferred code editor from their official websites.

## Step 1: Verify Node.js Installation

Once you have installed Node.js, you can verify its installation by opening a command prompt or terminal and running the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

This command will display the installed version of Node.js. Make sure the version is displayed without any errors.

## Step 2: Install a Code Editor

Choose a code editor that suits your preferences and install it on your computer. Here, we will use Visual Studio Code as an example.

1. Download Visual Studio Code from the official website: [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).

2. Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

## Step 3: Create a New Project Directory

Now that you have set up the necessary software, you can create a new project directory where you will store all the files related to your Order Tracking and Status Updates feature.

1. Choose a suitable location on your computer where you want to create the project directory. For example, you can create a "Projects" folder on your desktop.

2. Open your preferred code editor and navigate to the chosen location.

3. Create a new folder with a descriptive name for your project. For example, you can name it "order-tracking-system".

## Step 4: Initialize a New Git Repository

To track changes in your project and collaborate with others, it's beneficial to use version control. Git is a popular version control system that allows you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with other developers.

1. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to your project directory. For example:

```bash
cd path/to/order-tracking-system
```

2. Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

This will create a hidden `.git` directory in your project, which stores Git-related information.

## Step 5: Create a Basic File Structure

Organizing your project files in a structured manner is important for better maintainability. Here, we will create a basic file structure with separate folders for the frontend and backend components.

1. In your project directory, create two subfolders: `frontend` and `backend`.

```bash
mkdir frontend backend
```

2. The `frontend` folder will contain the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files responsible for the user interface, while the `backend` folder will house the server-side code.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your local development environment by installing Node.js, a code editor, and creating the necessary project directory with a basic file structure.

In the next guide, we will focus on designing the user interface by creating wireframes or mockups for the Order Tracking and

 Status Updates feature.

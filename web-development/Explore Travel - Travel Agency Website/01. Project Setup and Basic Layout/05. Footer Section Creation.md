# Creating a Footer Section with Copyright Information

In this guide, we will focus on creating a footer section for our Travel Agency website. The footer section will contain copyright information that will be displayed at the bottom of each page. This task is part of "Module 1: Setup and Basic Layout" of the project.

## Step 1: Open the HTML File
1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor of your choice. This file is located inside the `pages` folder of your project.

## Step 2: Add the Footer Section
1. Inside the `<body>` tags of the `index.html` file, locate the opening and closing `<footer>` tags. If they don't exist, add them at an appropriate location within the `<body>` tags.

2. Add the following code inside the `<footer>` tags to create the footer section:

```html
<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2023 Travel Agency. All rights reserved.</p>
</footer>
```

Let's break down the code:

- `<footer>`: This element represents the footer section of your webpage.
- `<p>&copy; 2023 Travel Agency. All rights reserved.</p>`: This adds a paragraph (`<p>`) with the copyright information. You can customize the text to include the relevant year and your agency's name.

## Step 3: Style the Footer Section
1. To style the footer section, you can add CSS code to the `style.css` file located in the `css` folder of your project. If the file doesn't exist, create it inside the `css` folder.

2. Open the `style.css` file in a text editor and add the following code:

```css
/* Style the footer section */
footer {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
}

footer p {
  font-size: 14px;
  margin: 0;
}
```

The code above provides some basic styling for the footer section. It sets the background color of the footer to `#333` (dark gray), the text color to `#fff` (white), and aligns the content in the center. It also adds some padding to create spacing around the text.

## Step 4: Save the Changes and Review
1. Save the changes made to the `index.html` and `style.css` files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to review the footer section with the copyright information.

# Module 3: Model Training and Evaluation

## Task: Train the Sentiment Analysis Model using the Preprocessed Training Dataset

In this task, we will train a sentiment analysis model using the preprocessed training dataset. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the task of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. The trained model will be able to classify customer support messages based on their sentiment labels.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Select a Classification Algorithm

To train a sentiment analysis model, we need to choose a classification algorithm suitable for this task. There are various algorithms that can be used, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). For this guide, we will use the Random Forest algorithm as an example.

### Step 2: Prepare the Training Data

Before training the model, we need to prepare the preprocessed training dataset. Make sure you have completed the previous modules, including data collection, exploration, text preprocessing, and feature extraction.

Let's assume we have the following variables:

- `X_train`: Preprocessed text features of the training dataset
- `y_train`: Sentiment labels of the training dataset

Ensure that the `X_train` is a matrix-like object where each row represents a document (customer support message) and each column represents a feature (word or n-gram). `y_train` should be a 1-dimensional array-like object containing the corresponding sentiment labels.

### Step 3: Import the Required Libraries

To train the sentiment analysis model using the Random Forest algorithm, we need to import the necessary libraries. In this guide, we will use the `scikit-learn` library, a popular machine learning library in Python.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
```

### Step 4: Initialize and Train the Model

Now, let's initialize the Random Forest classifier and train it using the preprocessed training dataset.

```python
# Initialize the Random Forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()

# Train the model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

In the code snippet above, we created an instance of the `RandomForestClassifier` class and assigned it to the `clf` variable. Then, we trained the model by calling the `fit` method and passing the preprocessed training dataset (`X_train` and `y_train`) as arguments.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Model's Performance

After training the model, it is crucial to evaluate its performance to assess how well it can predict the sentiment labels. There are several evaluation metrics commonly used for classification tasks, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Predict sentiment labels for the training dataset
y_train_pred = clf.predict(X_train)

# Calculate evaluation metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_train, y_train_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_train, y_train_pred, average='weighted')
recall = recall_score(y_train, y_train_pred, average='weighted')
f1 = f1_score(y_train, y_train_pred, average='weighted')

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
print(f"F1-score: {f1:.2f}")
```

In the code snippet above, we imported the necessary evaluation metrics from `scikit-learn` and calculated them using the predicted sentiment labels (`y_train_pred`) and the true sentiment labels (`y_train`

).

### Step 6: Fine-tune the Model's Hyperparameters

To further improve the model's performance, we can fine-tune its hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are configuration settings that are not learned from the data but are set before training the model. Tuning these hyperparameters can help optimize the model's performance.

The specific hyperparameters to tune depend on the chosen algorithm. For example, in the case of Random Forest, we can adjust parameters such as the number of trees (`n_estimators`), maximum depth of the trees (`max_depth`), or the number of features considered at each split (`max_features`).

To fine-tune the hyperparameters, you can use techniques like grid search or random search to explore different combinations and select the best ones based on cross-validation performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define the hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 5, 10],
    'max_features': ['auto', 'sqrt']
}

# Initialize the GridSearchCV object
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=clf, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5)

# Perform the hyperparameter search
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the best hyperparameters
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
print("Best Hyperparameters:", best_params)
```

In the code snippet above, we imported the `GridSearchCV` class from `scikit-learn` to perform a grid search for the best hyperparameters. We defined a parameter grid containing different values for `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `max_features`. The `cv` parameter in `GridSearchCV` specifies the number of cross-validation folds.

After performing the hyperparameter search using `fit`, we can obtain the best hyperparameters using the `best_params_` attribute of the `GridSearchCV` object.

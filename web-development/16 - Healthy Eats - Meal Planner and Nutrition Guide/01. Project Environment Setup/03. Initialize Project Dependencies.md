

### 1. Open Terminal or Command Prompt
Open your preferred terminal or command prompt application. This will allow you to execute commands to initialize the project with dependencies.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Folder
Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project folder you created in the previous step. For example, if your project folder is named "MealPlanner" and it is located on your desktop, you can use the following command:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/MealPlanner
```
Replace `~/Desktop/MealPlanner` with the actual path to your project folder.

### 3. Initialize a Package Manager (e.g., npm, yarn)
To manage the project dependencies, you need to initialize a package manager. In this example, we will use npm (Node Package Manager), which is a popular choice for JavaScript projects. If you prefer yarn, you can substitute the commands accordingly.

Run the following command to initialize npm in your project folder:
```bash
npm init
```

You will be prompted to provide information about your project, such as the name, version, description, entry point, etc. You can press Enter to accept the default values for most of the prompts.

### 4. Install Required Packages
Once the package manager is initialized, you can proceed to install the necessary dependencies for your project. These dependencies may include libraries, frameworks, or other tools required to develop your application.

For example, if you are building a web application using a framework like React, you can install the React package by running the following command:
```bash
npm install react
```

Similarly, you can install any other required packages using the `npm install` command followed by the package name.

### 5. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
Depending on your project's requirements, you may choose to create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies from your system's global environment. This step is optional but recommended, especially for larger projects.

If you are using a JavaScript project, you can use tools like `nvm` or `nvm-windows` to manage multiple versions of Node.js.

### 6. Verify the Dependencies
After installing the required packages, you can check the project's dependencies by examining the `package.json` file located in your project folder. This file contains metadata and a list of dependencies for your project.

You can open the `package.json` file in a text editor or run the following command to display its contents:
```bash
cat package.json
```

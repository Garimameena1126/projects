# Create an Account Settings Page with a Form for Updating User Details

In this task, we will focus on creating an account settings page that allows users to update their details. We will implement a form where users can enter their new information, and upon submission, the updated details will be saved to the database. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Create the Account Settings Page

Create a new HTML page for the account settings. This page will contain a form where users can update their details, such as their name, email, password, and any other relevant information.

```html
<!-- Example account settings page -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Account Settings</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Account Settings</h1>

  <form action="/update" method="POST">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>

    <!-- Add other fields for additional user details -->

    <button type="submit">Update</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have created an HTML form with input fields for the user's name, email, and password. Ensure that the form's `action` attribute points to the appropriate route that handles the update process (e.g., `/update`).

## Step 2: Implement the Server-Side Route for Update

Set up a server-side route that handles the form submission and updates the user's details in the database.

```javascript
// Example route using Express.js to handle the form submission and update user details
app.post('/update', (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, password } = req.body;
  const userId = req.user.id;

  // Update the user details in the database
  User.update({
    name: name,
    email: email,
    password: password
  }, {
    where: {
      id: userId
    }
  })
  .then(() => {
    // Redirect the user to the profile page or display a success message
    res.redirect('/profile');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle any errors and display an error message
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('An error occurred');
  });
});
```

In this example, we define a server-side route using Express.js to handle the form submission. We extract the updated user details (`name`, `email`, `password`) from the request body. The `req.user.id` represents the ID of the logged-in user. We then use an ORM or database query to update the user details in the database.

## Step 3: Test the Account Settings Page

Run your application and navigate to the account settings page (`/settings` or as configured). Enter new details in the form fields and click the "Update" button. The form data will be submitted to the server-side route, which will update the user's details in the database.

Ensure that the page redirects to the profile page (`/profile`) upon successful update or displays an appropriate success message. If any errors occur during the update process, an error message should be displayed or an error status should be returned.

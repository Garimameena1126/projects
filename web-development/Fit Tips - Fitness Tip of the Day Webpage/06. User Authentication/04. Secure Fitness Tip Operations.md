##  Ensuring Authentication for Adding, Editing, and Deleting Fitness Tips

In this guide, we will focus on adding user authentication functionality to the project and implementing access control to restrict certain actions, such as adding, editing, or deleting fitness tips, to authenticated users only. Let's get started!

### Step 1: Set Up User Authentication System

1. Choose a user authentication system or library for your project. One popular option is Passport.js, which is compatible with Node.js and Express.

   ```bash
   npm install passport
   ```

   You may need to install additional packages depending on the authentication system you choose.

2. Configure the authentication system by setting up the necessary dependencies and middleware in your project. This typically involves adding the required packages, configuring session management, and setting up the user model.

   For example, if you are using Passport.js with Express and MongoDB, your setup may include the following steps:

   - Install the required packages:

     ```bash
     npm install passport passport-local express-session mongoose
     ```

   - Import the required modules in your application:

     ```javascript
     const passport = require('passport');
     const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;
     const session = require('express-session');
     const mongoose = require('mongoose');
     ```

   - Set up session management middleware:

     ```javascript
     app.use(session({
         secret: 'your-secret-key',
         resave: false,
         saveUninitialized: false
     }));
     ```

   - Set up Passport middleware:

     ```javascript
     app.use(passport.initialize());
     app.use(passport.session());
     ```

   - Create a user model and configure Passport's local strategy:

     ```javascript
     const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

     passport.use(new LocalStrategy(User.authenticate()));
     passport.serializeUser(User.serializeUser());
     passport.deserializeUser(User.deserializeUser());
     ```

   These steps are just an example, and the specific configuration may vary depending on the authentication system you choose. Be sure to refer to the documentation for your chosen library for detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Implement User Sign-Up and Login Functionality

1. Create a sign-up form in your web application to allow users to register for an account. The form should collect relevant user information, such as username and password.

   Example HTML form:

   ```html
   <form action="/signup" method="POST">
       <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required>
       <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required>
       <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
   </form>
   ```

2. Implement the sign-up route in your backend server to handle user registration. This route should validate the user input, create a new user in the database, and redirect the user to the login page.

   Example route handler with Express and Passport.js:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/signup', (req, res) => {
       const { username, password } = req.body;
       User.register(new User({ username }), password, (err) => {
           if (err) {
               // Handle error (e.g., duplicate username)
               res.redirect('/signup');
           } else {
               res.redirect('/login');
           }
       });
   });
   ```

3. Create a login form in your web application to allow users to authenticate themselves with their credentials.

   Example HTML form:

   ```html
   <form action="/login" method="POST">
       <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required>
       <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required>
       <button type="submit">Log In</button>
   </form>
   ```

4. Implement the login route in your backend server to handle user authentication. This route should use Passport's authentication middleware to check the user's credentials and redirect them to the appropriate page based on the result.

   Example route handler with Express and Passport.js:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/login', passport.authenticate('local', {
       successRedirect: '/dashboard',
       failureRedirect: '/login'
   }));
   ```

### Step 3: Implement Access Control for Fitness Tips

1. Modify your backend API endpoints for adding, editing, and deleting fitness tips to include authentication checks. This ensures that only authenticated users can perform these actions.

   Example route handler for adding a fitness tip with Express:

   ```javascript
   app.post('/api/fitness-tips', isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
       // Check if the user is authenticated
       if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
           // Process the request to add the fitness tip
           // ...
           res.sendStatus(200);
       } else {
           res.sendStatus(401); // Unauthorized
       }
   });
   ```

   In this example, the `isAuthenticated` middleware function checks if the user is authenticated before allowing the request to proceed. You can define this middleware function as follows:

   ```javascript
   function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
       if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
           return next();
       }
       res.redirect('/login');
   }
   ```

2. Apply similar authentication checks to the routes for editing and deleting fitness tips.

   Example route handlers:

   ```javascript
   app.put('/api/fitness-tips/:id', isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
       // Check if the user is authenticated and has permission to edit the fitness tip
       // ...
       res.sendStatus(200);
   });

   app.delete('/api/fitness-tips/:id', isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
       // Check if the user is authenticated and has permission to delete the fitness tip
       // ...
       res.sendStatus(200);
   });
   ```

### Step 4: Display Authentication Status and Provide Logout Functionality

1. Update your website's header or navigation menu to display the authentication status and provide a logout option.

   Example header HTML:

   ```html
   <header>
       <nav>
           <ul>
               <li>Welcome, {{username}}!</li>
               <li><a href="/logout">Logout</a></li>
           </ul>
       </nav>
   </header>
   ```

   Replace `{{username}}` with the actual username of the authenticated user.

2. Implement the logout route in your backend server to handle user logout. This route should clear the user's session and redirect them to the login page.

   Example route handler:

   ```javascript
   app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
       req.logout();
       res.redirect('/login');
   });
   ```

# Flight Price Prediction using Trained Model

In this guide, we will walk through the process of building a flight price prediction system using a trained machine learning model. We will cover all the necessary steps, from data preprocessing to model training and deployment. By following this guide, even beginners will be able to understand and implement the project successfully.



## 1. Introduction

Flight price prediction aims to estimate the cost of flight tickets based on various factors such as departure time, airline, route, and more. It enables travelers to make informed decisions by forecasting ticket prices for their desired travel dates. In this project, we will leverage machine learning techniques to develop a flight price prediction system.

## 2. Dataset

To build our prediction model, we require a dataset that contains historical flight data with corresponding ticket prices. You can obtain such datasets from various sources, including online repositories or APIs. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume we have a CSV file named "flight_data.csv" that contains the necessary information.

The dataset should include relevant features such as departure and arrival locations, airline, date, and ticket price. Ensure the dataset is well-structured and does not contain missing values.

## 3. Data Preprocessing

Before training our machine learning model, we need to preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for training. Follow these steps to preprocess the dataset:

1. Load the dataset into your preferred programming environment.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data distribution and identify any anomalies.
3. Handle missing values by either removing rows with missing values or imputing them using appropriate techniques (e.g., mean, median, or mode imputation).
4. Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding, depending on the nature of the data.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Typically, a split of 70% for training and 30% for testing is recommended.

## 4. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves transforming the existing dataset by creating additional relevant features or modifying existing ones to improve the model's performance. In our flight price prediction system, you can consider the following feature engineering techniques:

1. Extracting features from date and time, such as day of the week, month, or hour of the day, which may influence flight prices.
2. Calculating the duration of the flight by subtracting the departure and arrival times.
3. Creating derived features like the total number of stops, route popularity, or seasonality indicators.

## 5. Model Training

Now that we have preprocessed and engineered our features, it's time to train a machine learning model to predict flight prices. In this guide, we will use the Random Forest algorithm as an example. Follow these steps to train the model:

1. Import the required libraries in your chosen programming language, such as scikit-learn for machine learning.
2. Split the preprocessed dataset into input features (X) and the target variable (y), where X contains all the features except the ticket price, and y contains the ticket prices.
3. Initialize a Random Forest Regression model.
4. Fit the model using the training data (X_train, y_train).
5. Optionally, tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize the model's performance.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)



# Initialize and train the Random Forest Regression model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## 6. Model Evaluation

After training the model, we need to evaluate its performance to ensure its accuracy and generalization capabilities. Follow these steps to evaluate the trained flight price prediction model:

1. Predict flight prices using the trained model on the test dataset (X_test).
2. Calculate appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), or root mean squared error (RMSE).
3. Analyze the evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance. Lower values of MAE, MSE, or RMSE indicate better performance.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Predict flight prices
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate mean absolute error
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Absolute Error:", mae)
```

## 7. Deployment

Once we are satisfied with the model's performance, we can deploy it to make flight price predictions accessible to users. Follow these steps to deploy the model:

1. Save the trained model to a file using serialization techniques, such as pickle or joblib.
2. Create a web application or API that exposes a prediction endpoint.
3. Load the saved model in the application.
4. Implement the necessary logic to accept input parameters (e.g., departure and arrival locations, date) and use the loaded model to predict the flight price.
5. Return the predicted price to the user through the web application or API.

In this task, we will incorporate basic styling for the different sections of the website using CSS. This will add visual appeal and make each section stand out. Follow the steps below to style each section:

## Step 1: Identify Website Sections

1. Open your HTML file where you have created the structure for the website.
2. Identify the different sections of your website. For example, header, navigation, services, team, portfolio, and footer.

## Step 2: Style the Header Section

1. Open your CSS file.
2. To style the header section, use the appropriate selector. For example:
    ```css
    header {
      background-color: #333;
      color: #fff;
      padding: 20px;
      text-align: center;
    }
    ```
3. Customize the styles according to your design preferences. You can modify properties like `background-color`, `color`, `padding`, and `text-align` to achieve the desired look.

## Step 3: Style the Navigation Section

1. To style the navigation section, use the appropriate selector. For example:
    ```css
    nav {
      background-color: #f4f4f4;
      padding: 10px;
    }
    ```
2. Customize the styles as needed. You can adjust the `background-color` and `padding` to match your design.

## Step 4: Style the Services Section

1. To style the services section, use the appropriate selector. For example:
    ```css
    .services {
      background-color: #f9f9f9;
      padding: 20px;
    }
    ```
2. Customize the styles to suit your design. You can modify the `background-color` and `padding` properties.

## Step 5: Style the Team Section

1. To style the team section, use the appropriate selector. For example:
    ```css
    .team {
      background-color: #eee;
      padding: 20px;
    }
    ```
2. Customize the styles as per your design requirements. Adjust the `background-color` and `padding` values accordingly.

## Step 6: Style the Portfolio Section

1. To style the portfolio section, use the appropriate selector. For example:
    ```css
    .portfolio {
      background-color: #f4f4f4;
      padding: 20px;
    }
    ```
2. Customize the styles to match your design choices. Modify the `background-color` and `padding` properties as needed.

## Step 7: Style the Footer Section

1. To style the footer section, use the appropriate selector. For example:
    ```css
    footer {
      background-color: #333;
      color: #fff;
      padding: 20px;
      text-align: center;
    }
    ```
2. Customize the styles based on your design preferences. Adjust the `background-color`, `color`, `padding`, and `text-align` values as desired.

## Step 8: Save and Preview the Changes

1. Save your CSS file.
2. Refresh your website in the browser and observe the changes. Each section should now have basic styling applied according to the CSS rules you defined.

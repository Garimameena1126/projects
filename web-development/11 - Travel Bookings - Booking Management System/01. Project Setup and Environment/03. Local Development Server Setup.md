# Setting Up a Local Development Server

In this task, we will guide you through the process of setting up a local development server for your web development project. The local development server will allow you to test and preview your website locally before deploying it to a live server. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Choose a Local Development Server

There are several options available for setting up a local development server. Some popular choices include:

1. **http-server**: A simple command-line tool that serves static files over HTTP.
2. **live-server**: A development server with live reloading capability, which automatically refreshes the page whenever changes are made to the code.
3. **XAMPP**: A complete web server solution that includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

For this guide, we will use the **http-server** package, which is easy to set up and use.

## Step 2: Install Node.js and npm

To use the **http-server** package, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Follow these steps to install them:

1. Go to the official Node.js website: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

2. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

4. Verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following commands:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

   You should see the versions of Node.js and npm printed in the terminal.

## Step 3: Set Up a New Project Directory (Optional)

If you haven't already set up a project directory, you can follow the steps in the previous task to create a new project directory and initialize a Git repository.

## Step 4: Install and Start the http-server

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command. For example:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. Install the `http-server` package globally by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

4. Once the installation is complete, you can start the local development server by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

   By default, the server will start on `http://localhost:8080`. You can access your website by opening this URL in your web browser.

5. To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a local development server for your project.

## Step 5: Preview Your Website

With the local development server running, you can now preview your website in the web browser.

1. Open your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

2. Enter the following URL in the address bar:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. Press `Enter` to load the website.

   You should see your website displayed in the browser, just as it would appear on a live server.

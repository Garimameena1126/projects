1. Open your text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the terminal or command prompt. For example:

   ```bash
   mkdir project-backend
   cd project-backend
   ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

   This will generate a `package.json` file with default settings.

4. Install the Express framework by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

   This will download and install the Express package into your project.

5. Create a new file called `server.js` in your project directory.

6. Open the `server.js` file and import the Express module at the top:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   ```

7. Create an instance of the Express application by calling the `express()` function:

   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   ```

8. Define a route to handle incoming requests. For example, create a route to handle GET requests to the root URL (`/`) and send a simple response:

   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, world!');
   });
   ```

9. Specify the port number on which the server will listen. Add the following code at the end of the file:

   ```javascript
   const port = 3000; // Replace with your desired port number

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

   Make sure to replace `3000` with the desired port number for your server.

10. Save the changes to the `server.js` file.

11. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory (`project-backend`).

12. Start the server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

    You should see a message in the console indicating that the server is running on the specified port.

13. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port number you specified). You should see the "Hello, world!" message displayed in the browser.

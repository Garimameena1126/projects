1. Open the CSS file associated with your HTML file where the product cards are being generated.

2. Identify the CSS selector for the product card elements. This selector will be used to apply styling to the product cards. For example, you can use the class selector ".product-card" assuming each product card has the "product-card" class.

3. Define the desired styles for the product cards using the identified selector. Below are some examples of styles you can apply:

   ```css
   .product-card {
     border: 1px solid #ccc;
     padding: 10px;
     margin: 10px;
     width: 200px;
     text-align: center;
   }

   .product-image {
     width: 100px;
     height: 100px;
     object-fit: cover;
     margin-bottom: 10px;
   }

   .product-name {
     font-weight: bold;
     margin-bottom: 5px;
   }

   .product-price {
     color: green;
   }
   ```

   In the above example, we apply styles to the product card, product image, product name, and product price.

4. Save the CSS file.

5. Refresh your web page in the browser to see the styled product cards.

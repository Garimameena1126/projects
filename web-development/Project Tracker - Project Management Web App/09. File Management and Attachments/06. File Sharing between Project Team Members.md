# Implementing File Sharing Functionality

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of implementing file sharing functionality between project team members for your project management app. By the end of this guide, users will be able to share files related to a project with their team members. We will focus on server-side implementation and assume you have already set up file uploads and storage. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Designing the User Interface

Before implementing the file sharing functionality, let's design the user interface to provide a seamless experience for users to share files. Here's an example of how you can structure the UI:

1. Add a button or link labeled "Share" next to each file in the project view.
2. When the "Share" button is clicked, display a modal or overlay with a form to enter the email addresses of team members to share the file with.
3. Include an "Add Team Member" button to dynamically add more email input fields if needed.
4. Add a "Share" button within the modal to initiate the file sharing process.
5. Consider adding validation to ensure that valid email addresses are entered.

# Step 2: Implementing the Server-Side Functionality

Next, let's implement the server-side functionality to handle file sharing requests and manage permissions. We will assume you are using a backend framework like Node.js with Express.

1. Create an API endpoint to handle the file sharing request. For example, you can define a route like `/api/projects/:projectId/files/:fileId/share`.
2. In the route handler, validate the user's authentication and authorization to ensure they have the necessary permissions to share files.
3. Retrieve the file details from the database based on the `projectId` and `fileId` parameters.
4. Retrieve the list of email addresses entered by the user from the request body.
5. Iterate through the list of email addresses and perform the following steps for each email:
   - Check if the user with the specified email exists in the project team members.
   - If the user exists, update the file's permissions to grant access to the user.
   - If the user does not exist, consider sending an invitation email to join the project.
6. After sharing the file with all specified team members, send a response indicating the success or failure of the operation.

Here's an example of how the server-side code might look in Node.js with Express:

```javascript
// Import necessary modules and define the route
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Define the file sharing route
router.post('/projects/:projectId/files/:fileId/share', (req, res) => {
  const { projectId, fileId } = req.params;
  const { emails } = req.body;

  // TODO: Perform authentication and authorization checks

  // Retrieve the file details from the database based on projectId and fileId
  const file = File.findById(fileId);

  // Iterate through the list of email addresses
  emails.forEach(email => {
    // TODO: Check if the user with the specified email exists in the project team members
    // If the user exists, update the file's permissions to grant access to the user
    // If the user does not exist, send an invitation email to join the project
  });

  // Send a response indicating the success or failure of the operation
  res.json({ message: 'File shared successfully' });
});

// Export the router
module.exports = router;
```

Note: The code above is just a simplified example to demonstrate the concept. You'll need to adapt it to your specific project structure and database implementation.

## Step 3: Updating the User Interface

Now that the server-side functionality is implemented, let's update the user interface to handle the file sharing process.

1. Use JavaScript to capture the user's input (email addresses) when the "Share" button is clicked.
2. Send an AJAX request to the server-side route defined in Step 2, passing the project and file IDs along with the list of email addresses.
3. Display a success message to the user if the file sharing operation is successful.
4. If there are any errors or failures, display an appropriate error message to the user.

Here's an example of how you can use JavaScript and AJAX to handle the file sharing process:

```javascript
// Assuming you have included a library like jQuery for AJAX

// Capture the share button click event
$('.share-button').click(function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  const projectId = $(this).data('project-id');
  const fileId = $(this).data('file-id');
  const emails = getEmailsFromForm(); // Implement this function to retrieve the list of email addresses from the form

  // Send an AJAX request to the server-side route
  $.ajax({
    url: `/api/projects/${projectId}/files/${fileId}/share`,
    method: 'POST',
    data: { emails },
    success: function(response) {
      // Display success message to the user
      alert(response.message);
    },
    error: function(error) {
      // Display error message to the user
      alert('File sharing failed. Please try again later.');
    }
  });
});
```

In this task, we will focus on enhancing the user experience for mobile users by implementing touch-friendly interactions. This includes adding touch-enabled date pickers and dropdowns. Follow the steps below to accomplish this:

1. Choose a Touch-Friendly Library
   - Select a JavaScript library or framework that provides touch-friendly components and interactions.
   - One popular library for touch-friendly interactions is **React Touch Events**.
   - Install the library by including it in your project's dependencies.

2. Add the Date Picker Component
   - Import the necessary components from the library.
   - Create a date picker component that is touch-friendly and suitable for mobile users.
   - Use the library's documentation and examples to understand how to configure and use the date picker component.
   - Below is an example of a touch-friendly date picker component using React Touch Events:
     ```jsx
     import React, { useState } from 'react';
     import { DatePicker } from 'react-touch-events';

     const MyDatePicker = () => {
       const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(null);

       const handleDateChange = (date) => {
         setSelectedDate(date);
       };

       return (
         <div>
           <DatePicker value={selectedDate} onChange={handleDateChange} />
         </div>
       );
     };

     export default MyDatePicker;
     ```

3. Implement the Dropdown Component
   - Import the necessary components from the library.
   - Create a touch-friendly dropdown component suitable for mobile users.
   - Utilize the library's documentation and examples to understand how to configure and use the dropdown component.
   - Here's an example of a touch-friendly dropdown component using React Touch Events:
     ```jsx
     import React, { useState } from 'react';
     import { Dropdown } from 'react-touch-events';

     const MyDropdown = () => {
       const [selectedOption, setSelectedOption] = useState(null);

       const handleOptionChange = (option) => {
         setSelectedOption(option);
       };

       return (
         <div>
           <Dropdown value={selectedOption} onChange={handleOptionChange}>
             <option value="option1">Option 1</option>
             <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
             <option value="option3">Option 3</option>
           </Dropdown>
         </div>
       );
     };

     export default MyDropdown;
     ```

4. Customize Styling
   - Customize the styling of the date picker and dropdown components to match the overall design of your website.
   - Modify CSS classes or use inline styles to adjust the appearance, size, and colors of the components.
   - Ensure that the components are visually appealing and provide a seamless user experience.

5. Test on Mobile Devices
   - Test the touch-friendly interactions on various mobile devices to ensure they work as intended.
   - Use device emulators, such as Chrome DevTools or browser extensions, to simulate different mobile devices and screen sizes.
   - Verify that the date picker and dropdown components are responsive and provide a smooth user experience on touchscreens.

1. Open the JavaScript file associated with your project.

2. Modify the code that handles adding products to the wishlist to include authentication checks. This ensures that only authenticated users can add products to their wishlist.

   ```javascript
   const addToWishlistButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.add-to-wishlist');

   addToWishlistButtons.forEach((button) => {
     button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
       event.preventDefault();

       if (authenticatedUser) {
         // Proceed with adding the product to the wishlist
       } else {
         // Display an error message or redirect to the login page
       }
     });
   });
   ```

   In the code above, we added an `if-else` statement to check if the user is authenticated before allowing them to add a product to their wishlist. If the user is authenticated, the code can proceed with adding the product to the wishlist. Otherwise, you can display an error message or redirect the user to the login page.

3. Update the code that handles removing products from the wishlist to include authentication checks. This ensures that only authenticated users can remove products from their wishlist.

   ```javascript
   const removeFromWishlistButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.remove-from-wishlist');

   removeFromWishlistButtons.forEach((button) => {
     button.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
       event.preventDefault();

       if (authenticatedUser) {
         // Proceed with removing the product from the wishlist
       } else {
         // Display an error message or redirect to the login page
       }
     });
   });
   ```

   In the code above, we added an `if-else` statement to check if the user is authenticated before allowing them to remove a product from their wishlist. If the user is authenticated, the code can proceed with removing the product from the wishlist. Otherwise, you can display an error message or redirect the user to the login page.

4. Test your application by attempting to add or remove products from the wishlist as an authenticated user and verifying that the appropriate actions are allowed. Also, test the behavior when attempting to perform wishlist operations as an unauthenticated user.

5. Make further adjustments to the code and functionality as needed based on your project's requirements.

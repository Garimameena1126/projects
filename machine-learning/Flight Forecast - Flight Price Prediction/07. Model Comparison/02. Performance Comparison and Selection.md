##  Model Comparison 

In this module, we will train and evaluate multiple regression models to compare their performance for flight price prediction. We will explore three commonly used models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. By comparing their results, we can identify the most accurate model for our project.

Let's proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

First, we need to import the libraries that will be used for model comparison and evaluation. In this case, we will be using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
```

### Step 2: Load the preprocessed dataset

Before training the models, we need to load the preprocessed dataset that we created in the previous modules. Ensure that you have the dataset file available and adjust the file path accordingly.

```python
# Load the preprocessed dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('preprocessed_dataset.csv')
```

### Step 3: Split the dataset into features and target variable

Next, we will split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y). The features are the independent variables that we will use to predict the flight prices, while the target variable is the actual flight prices.

```python
# Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = dataset.drop('Price', axis=1)
y = dataset['Price']
```

### Step 4: Split the data into training and testing sets

To evaluate the performance of the models, we need to split the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the models, while the testing set will be used to assess their performance.

```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Step 5: Train and evaluate the models

Now, we can proceed to train and evaluate the regression models. We will train each model on the training set and evaluate its performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

#### Linear Regression:

```python
# Train the Linear Regression model
linear_reg = LinearRegression()
linear_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
linear_pred = linear_reg.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
linear_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, linear_pred)
linear_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, linear_pred, squared=False)

# Display the evaluation results
print("Linear Regression Evaluation:")
print("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", linear_mae)
print("Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):", linear_rmse)
```

#### Random Forest Regression:

```python
# Train the Random Forest Regression model
rf_reg = RandomForestRegressor()
rf_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
rf_pred = rf_reg.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
rf_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, rf_pred)
rf_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, rf_pred, squared=False)

# Display the evaluation results
print("Random Forest Regression Evaluation:")
print("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", rf_mae)
print("Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):", rf_rmse)
```

#### Gradient Boosting Regression:

```python
# Train the Gradient Boosting Regression model
gb_reg = GradientBoostingRegressor()
gb_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
gb_pred = gb_reg.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
gb_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, gb_pred)
gb_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, gb_pred, squared=False)

# Display the evaluation results
print("Gradient Boosting Regression Evaluation:")
print("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", gb_mae)
print("Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):", gb_rmse)
```

### Step 6: Compare the model performances

After evaluating each model, we can compare their performances based on the MAE and RMSE values. Lower values indicate better performance.

```python
# Compare the model performances
performance_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Model': ['Linear Regression', 'Random Forest', 'Gradient Boosting'],
    'MAE': [linear_mae, rf_mae, gb_mae],
    'RMSE': [linear_rmse, rf_rmse, gb_rmse]
})

print("Model Comparison:")
print(performance_df)
```

### Step 7: Select the most accurate model

Based on the comparison, you can select the model with the lowest MAE and RMSE values as the most accurate model for flight price prediction.

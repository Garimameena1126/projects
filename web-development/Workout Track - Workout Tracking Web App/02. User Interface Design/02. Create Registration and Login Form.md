# Designing a Registration and Login Form for Users

In this guide, we will walk through the process of designing a registration and login form for users in our workout tracking app. The registration and login forms will allow users to create an account and securely access their data. We will use HTML and CSS to create the form layout and apply styles for a visually appealing user interface.

## Step 1: Create a New HTML File

1. Inside the `public` folder of your project, create a new file called `register.html`.

2. Open the `register.html` file in your preferred code editor.

3. Add the basic HTML structure to the file by typing the following code:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Registration Form</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Registration Form</h1>
        <!-- Add your form code here -->
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
    In the code above, we have set up the HTML document structure, including a title for the page and a reference to an external CSS file called `styles.css` for applying styles to our form.

## Step 2: Design the Registration Form

1. Inside the `body` element, add a `form` element to create the registration form. Give it an `id` attribute for later reference, such as `registration-form`.

    ```html
    <form id="registration-form">
        <!-- Form fields will be added here -->
    </form>
    ```

2. Inside the `form` element, add `label` and `input` elements for the required fields in the registration form. For example, let's include fields for name, email, and password.

    ```html
    <form id="registration-form">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
    
        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
    
        <!-- Additional form fields can be added here -->
    
        <button type="submit">Register</button>
    </form>
    ```

3. Add a submit button at the end of the form to allow users to register. We will handle form submission in later steps.

4. Save the `register.html` file.

## Step 3: Add CSS Styles

1. Create a new file called `styles.css` in the same directory as your `register.html` file.

2. Open the `styles.css` file in your code editor.

3. Apply CSS styles to the registration form to enhance its appearance and layout. You can customize the styles according to your design preferences. Here's an example of some basic styles:

    ```css
    /* Global styles */
    body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 20px;
    }
    
    /* Form styles */
    form {
        max-width: 400px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
    
    label {
        display: block;
        margin-bottom: 10px;
    }
    
    input {
        width: 100%;
        padding: 10px;
        margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    
    button[type="submit"] {
        background-color: #4CAF50;
        color: white;
        padding: 10px 20px;
        border: none;
        cursor: pointer;
    }
    
    button[type="submit"]:hover {
        background-color: #45a049;
    }
    
    h1 {
        text-align: center;
    }
    ```

    In the CSS code above, we have defined styles for the form layout, labels, input fields, and the submit button. Feel free to modify these styles or add additional styles to match your desired design.

4. Save the `styles.css` file.

## Step 4: View the Registration Form

1. Open the `register.html` file in your web browser.

2. You should now see the registration form displayed with the applied styles. Test the form by entering some sample data and clicking the submit button. However, the form doesn't perform any action yet, as we haven't implemented the form submission functionality.

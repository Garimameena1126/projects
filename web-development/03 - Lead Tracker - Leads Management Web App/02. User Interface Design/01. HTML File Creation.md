To start building the user interface for your lead management system, you need to create an HTML file. This guide will walk you through the process:

#### Step 1: Open a Text Editor

First, open your preferred text editor. You can use any text editor of your choice, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or Notepad++.

#### Step 2: Start a New HTML Document

Create a new file and save it with an `.html` extension. For example, you can name the file `index.html` or `lead-management.html`. This will be the main HTML file for your lead management system.

#### Step 3: Set Up the HTML Structure

Inside the newly created HTML file, start by adding the basic HTML structure. This includes the doctype declaration, the opening and closing `<html>` tags, and the `<head>` and `<body>` sections.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Lead Management System</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your HTML code goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

#### Step 4: Add a Page Title

Within the `<head>` section of the HTML file, add a `<title>` tag to specify the page title. This title will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

```html
<title>Lead Management System</title>
```

Replace "Lead Management System" with an appropriate title for your application.

#### Step 5: Build the User Interface

Inside the `<body>` section of the HTML file, you can now start building the user interface for your lead management system. Use HTML tags to structure and define the elements of your UI.

For example, you can create a heading using the `<h1>` tag:

```html
<h1>Welcome to the Lead Management System</h1>
```

Add additional HTML tags, such as `<p>` for paragraphs, `<input>` for form fields, `<button>` for buttons, and `<div>` for container elements, to structure your UI according to your design requirements.

```html
<!-- Example form field -->
<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name">

<!-- Example button -->
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

#### Step 6: Save the HTML File

After you have built the initial UI structure, save the HTML file. Choose a location and name that makes sense for your project. Make sure the file has the `.html` extension.

Congratulations! You have successfully created an HTML file for your lead management system.

#### Step 7: Preview the HTML File

To see a preview of your HTML file in a web browser, open the file using any web browser installed on your computer. Simply double-click the HTML file, and it will open in your default browser.

You should now see the basic UI elements you added to the HTML file rendered in the browser window.

#### Step 8: Continue Designing the User Interface

# Beginner's Guide: Displaying a List of Existing Reviews with Ratings

In this guide, we will focus on displaying a list of existing reviews with their associated ratings in your reviews and ratings system. We will provide step-by-step instructions and code examples to help beginners implement this functionality.

## Step 1: HTML Structure

Before displaying the list of reviews, ensure that you have the HTML structure in place to hold the reviews. Create a `<div>` element with an appropriate ID to serve as the container for the reviews. For example:

```html
<div id="review-list">
  <!-- Reviews will be dynamically added here -->
</div>
```

This `<div>` element with the ID "review-list" will be used to display the reviews.

## Step 2: Create a JavaScript Array

To simulate existing reviews, we will create a JavaScript array that stores the reviews and their associated ratings. This array will act as a data source for rendering the reviews on the page.

In your JavaScript file, create an array called `reviews` with sample review objects. Each object should have properties for the review text and the rating. For example:

```javascript
const reviews = [
  {
    review: "Great product! Highly recommended.",
    rating: 5
  },
  {
    review: "Average product. Could be better.",
    rating: 3
  },
  // Add more review objects as needed
];
```

Feel free to add more review objects to the `reviews` array to simulate a larger dataset.

## Step 3: Render Reviews

Now, let's write the code to render the reviews on the page. We will use JavaScript to dynamically generate the necessary HTML elements and populate them with the review data.

In your JavaScript file, add the following code:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const reviewList = document.getElementById('review-list');

  // Iterate over the reviews array
  reviews.forEach(function(review) {
    // Create a new review element
    const reviewElement = document.createElement('div');
    reviewElement.classList.add('review');

    // Create elements for review text and rating
    const reviewTextElement = document.createElement('p');
    reviewTextElement.textContent = review.review;

    const ratingElement = document.createElement('p');
    ratingElement.textContent = `Rating: ${review.rating}`;

    // Append the elements to the review container
    reviewElement.appendChild(reviewTextElement);
    reviewElement.appendChild(ratingElement);

    // Append the review element to the review list container
    reviewList.appendChild(reviewElement);
  });
});
```

In this code, we first select the review list container element using `getElementById()` and store it in the `reviewList` variable.

Next, we use the `forEach()` method to iterate over each review object in the `reviews` array. Inside the loop, we create a new `<div>` element (`reviewElement`) and add the CSS class "review" to it.

We then create `<p>` elements for the review text (`reviewTextElement`) and the rating (`ratingElement`), and set their content using the properties of each review object.

Finally, we append the review text and rating elements to the review element, and then append the review element to the review list container.

## Step 4: CSS Styling

To ensure the reviews and ratings are visually displayed in an appealing manner, we can apply CSS styles to them. Open your CSS file or `<style>` block and add the following styles:

```css
.review {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.review p {
  margin: 0;
}
```

These styles add a border, padding, and margin to each

 review element (`<div>` with the "review" class). The nested `<p>` elements within each review will have their default margin removed (`margin: 0;`).

Feel free to customize these styles to match the design of your reviews and ratings system.

## Step 5: Test the Reviews Display

Save all your HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, and open the HTML file in your web browser. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the existing reviews and their associated ratings displayed on the page.

If you added more review objects to the `reviews` array, they should be rendered as well.

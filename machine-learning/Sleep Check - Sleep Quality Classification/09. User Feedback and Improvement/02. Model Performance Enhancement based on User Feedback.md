# User Feedback and Model Improvement

In this guide, we will explore the task of implementing a feedback mechanism where users can provide information about their actual sleep quality and provide feedback on the accuracy of the predictions. We will leverage this feedback to continuously improve the model's performance and make it more personalized.

## Step 1: Gathering User Feedback

The first step is to create a user interface that allows users to provide feedback on their sleep quality. For this task, we will develop a simple command-line application where users can input their sleep-related information and provide feedback.

1. Create a new Python file and import the necessary libraries:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report
```

2. Load the previously trained model that performs sleep quality classification:
```python
from sklearn.externals import joblib

model = joblib.load('sleep_quality_model.pkl')
```

3. Define a function to collect user feedback:
```python
def collect_user_feedback():
    print("Please provide feedback on your sleep quality.")
    sleep_duration = float(input("Sleep duration (in hours): "))
    bedtime_routine = input("Bedtime routine (e.g., reading, meditation): ")
    exercise = input("Exercise (yes/no): ")
    stress_level = int(input("Stress level (on a scale of 1-10): "))
    actual_sleep_quality = input("Actual sleep quality (good/bad): ")

    return {
        'Sleep Duration': sleep_duration,
        'Bedtime Routine': bedtime_routine,
        'Exercise': exercise,
        'Stress Level': stress_level,
        'Actual Sleep Quality': actual_sleep_quality
    }
```

4. Define a function to predict sleep quality based on user input:
```python
def predict_sleep_quality(user_input):
    input_data = pd.DataFrame(user_input, index=[0])
    input_data['Exercise'] = np.where(input_data['Exercise'] == 'yes', 1, 0)

    prediction = model.predict(input_data)
    return prediction[0]
```

5. Use the functions defined above to collect user feedback and make predictions:
```python
user_feedback = collect_user_feedback()
predicted_sleep_quality = predict_sleep_quality(user_feedback)

print(f"\nPredicted sleep quality: {predicted_sleep_quality}")
```

## Step 2: Analyzing User Feedback

Once we have collected user feedback and made predictions, we can analyze the feedback to identify areas for improvement in the model. We can calculate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and compare the predicted sleep quality with the actual sleep quality provided by the user.

1. Define a function to calculate performance metrics:
```python
def calculate_performance_metrics(actual, predicted):
    report = classification_report(actual, predicted)
    confusion = confusion_matrix(actual, predicted)
    accuracy = np.diagonal(confusion).sum() / confusion.sum()

    return report, confusion, accuracy
```

2. Analyze the model's performance using the collected user feedback:
```python
actual_sleep_quality = [user_feedback['Actual Sleep Quality']]
predicted_sleep_quality = [predicted_sleep_quality]

report, confusion, accuracy = calculate_performance_metrics(actual_sleep_quality, predicted_sleep_quality)

print(f"\nPerformance Metrics:\n{report}")
print(f"\nConfusion Matrix:\n{confusion}")
print(f"\nAccuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

## Step 3: Updating the Model

To improve the model's performance and make it more personalized, we can update the model based on the feedback received from users. One approach is to retrain the model using the updated dataset that includes the user feedback.

1. Load the original dataset used for training:
```python
dataset =

 pd.read_csv('sleep_data.csv')
```

2. Append the user feedback to the dataset:
```python
feedback_df = pd.DataFrame(user_feedback, index=[0])
updated_dataset = dataset.append(feedback_df, ignore_index=True)
```

3. Preprocess the updated dataset as done in Module 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering.

4. Split the updated dataset into features (X) and labels (y):
```python
X_updated = updated_dataset.drop('Sleep Quality', axis=1)
y_updated = updated_dataset['Sleep Quality']
```

5. Retrain the model using the updated dataset:
```python
updated_model = # Select and train a suitable classification model
```

6. Save the updated model for future use:
```python
joblib.dump(updated_model, 'updated_sleep_quality_model.pkl')
```

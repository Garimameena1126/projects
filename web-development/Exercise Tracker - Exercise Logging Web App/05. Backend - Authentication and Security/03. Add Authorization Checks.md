#  Add Authorization Checks for Exercise Logging Functionality

In this task, we will add authorization checks to ensure that only logged-in users can access the exercise logging functionality. This means that users must be authenticated and have the necessary permissions to perform actions related to exercise logging. We will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and implement middleware to check the user's authorization status for protected routes.

Let's get started with the step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Verify JWT and Extract User ID

1. Open the file where your exercise logging routes are defined.

2. Import the necessary dependencies:

   ```javascript
   const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
   const { JWT_SECRET } = require('./config'); // Your JWT secret key
   ```

3. Create a middleware function to verify the JWT and extract the user ID. This function should be placed before the exercise logging routes in the middleware chain. For example:

   ```javascript
   // Middleware to verify JWT and extract user ID
   function authenticateUser(req, res, next) {
     // Get the JWT from the request headers or query parameters
     const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1] || req.query.token;

     if (!token) {
       return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
     }

     try {
       // Verify the JWT and extract the user ID
       const { userId } = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
       req.userId = userId;
       next();
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error verifying JWT', error);
       res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
     }
   }
   ```

   This middleware function performs the following steps:
   - Extracts the JWT from the request headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) or query parameters (e.g., `?token=<token>`).
   - If no JWT is found, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response.
   - Verifies the JWT using the secret key and extracts the user ID from the payload.
   - Sets the user ID in the request object for future use.
   - Calls the `next()` function to pass control to the next middleware in the chain.

4. Save the changes to the file.

Congratulations! You have implemented the middleware to authenticate and extract the user ID from the JWT.

## Step 2: Protect Exercise Logging Routes

Now that we have the authentication middleware in place, we can protect the exercise logging routes to ensure only authorized users can access them. Follow these steps:

1. Open the file where your exercise logging routes are defined.

2. Import the `authenticateUser` middleware created in the previous step:

   ```javascript
   const { authenticateUser } = require('./middleware');
   ```

3. Apply the `authenticateUser` middleware to the exercise logging routes that require authorization. For example:

   ```javascript
   // Exercise logging routes
   app.post('/exercises', authenticateUser, (req, res) => {
     // Handle exercise creation
   });

   app.put('/exercises/:id', authenticateUser, (req, res) => {
     // Handle exercise update
   });

   app.delete('/exercises/:id', authenticateUser, (req, res) => {
     // Handle exercise deletion
   });
   ```

   By adding `authenticateUser` as middleware for these routes, we ensure that the user must be authenticated (i.e., provide a valid JWT) to access them.

4. Save the changes to the file.

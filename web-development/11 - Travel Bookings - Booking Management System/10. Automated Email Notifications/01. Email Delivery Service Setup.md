# Set Up an Email Delivery Service

In this guide, we will walk through the process of setting up an email delivery service for your project. By integrating an email delivery service like SendGrid or Mailgun, you can easily send automated emails to users, such as booking confirmations and updates. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Select an Email Delivery Service

First, you need to choose an email delivery service provider. Two popular options are SendGrid and Mailgun. Both services offer reliable email delivery, robust APIs, and extensive documentation. For this guide, we will use SendGrid as an example.

1. Visit the SendGrid website at [https://sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com) and sign up for an account.
2. Follow the steps to complete the account setup and verify your email address.

## Step 2: Obtain API Key

To integrate SendGrid with your project, you need an API key. The API key allows your application to securely communicate with SendGrid's servers. Here's how you can obtain an API key:

1. Sign in to your SendGrid account.
2. Navigate to the "Settings" menu and select "API Keys."
3. Click on the "Create API Key" button.
4. Provide a name for your API key (e.g., "Project Email Delivery") and choose the desired permissions.
5. Click on the "Create & View" button to generate the API key.
6. Make sure to copy the generated API key as you will need it in the next steps.

## Step 3: Set Up the Email Delivery Service

Now that you have the API key, it's time to set up the email delivery service in your project.

1. Install the SendGrid library using a package manager. For example, if you're using Node.js with npm, run the following command:
   
   ```shell
   npm install @sendgrid/mail
   ```

2. Import the SendGrid library into your project and configure it with your API key. Replace `YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained in the previous step. Here's an example in Node.js:

   ```javascript
   const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
   sgMail.setApiKey('YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY');
   ```

## Step 4: Send a Test Email

To ensure that the email delivery service is set up correctly, let's send a test email.

1. Create a test email template using HTML and placeholders for dynamic content. For example:

   ```html
   <html>
     <body>
       <h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1>
       <p>This is a test email sent from my project.</p>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. Use the SendGrid library to send the email. Replace `YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS` with the recipient's email address. Here's an example in Node.js:

   ```javascript
   const msg = {
     to: 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS',
     from: 'YOUR_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS',
     subject: 'Test Email',
     html: '<h1>Hello, {{name}}!</h1><p>This is a test email sent from my project.</p>',
     dynamicTemplateData: {
       name: 'John Doe',
     },
   };

   sgMail.send(msg)
     .then(() => console.log('Test email sent!'))
     .catch((error) => console.error(error));
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS` with the email address you want to use as the sender.

3. Run the code and check the specified recipient email address for the test email. Make sure to replace any placeholders (`{{name}}` in the example) with actual content.

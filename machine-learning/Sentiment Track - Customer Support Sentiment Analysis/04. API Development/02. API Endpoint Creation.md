
#  Create an API endpoint for sentiment analysis

In this task, we will create an API endpoint that allows users to submit customer support messages for sentiment analysis. The API will take the user input, preprocess it, pass it to the trained model for sentiment prediction, and return the predicted sentiment label as the API response. We will use the Flask web framework for this implementation.

## Step 1: Set up Flask

To begin, we need to set up a Flask application to handle HTTP requests. Follow the steps below:

1. Install Flask using the following command:
```python
pip install flask
```

2. Create a new Python file named `app.py` and import the necessary modules:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
```

3. Initialize the Flask application:
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

## Step 2: Define the API endpoint

Next, we will define the API endpoint that will receive the customer support messages and perform sentiment analysis. Add the following code to your `app.py` file:

```python
@app.route('/sentiment-analysis', methods=['POST'])
def sentiment_analysis():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Retrieve the user input
    user_input = data['message']

    # Preprocess the user input (apply the same preprocessing steps used during training)
    # ...

    # Pass the preprocessed input to the trained model for sentiment prediction
    # ...

    # Perform sentiment prediction and obtain the predicted sentiment label
    # ...

    # Return the predicted sentiment label as the API response
    response = {'sentiment': predicted_sentiment_label}
    return jsonify(response)
```

## Step 3: Preprocess the user input

Before passing the user input to the trained model, we need to preprocess it by applying the same preprocessing steps used during training. This ensures consistency and compatibility between the input data and the model. Add the necessary preprocessing code inside the `sentiment_analysis` function:

```python
from preprocessing import preprocess_text

@app.route('/sentiment-analysis', methods=['POST'])
def sentiment_analysis():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Retrieve the user input
    user_input = data['message']

    # Preprocess the user input (apply the same preprocessing steps used during training)
    preprocessed_input = preprocess_text(user_input)

    # Pass the preprocessed input to the trained model for sentiment prediction
    # ...

    # Perform sentiment prediction and obtain the predicted sentiment label
    # ...

    # Return the predicted sentiment label as the API response
    response = {'sentiment': predicted_sentiment_label}
    return jsonify(response)
```

In the above example, we assume that the `preprocess_text` function is implemented in a separate module named `preprocessing.py`. You can define this function according to your preprocessing requirements.

## Step 4: Load the trained model

Before performing sentiment prediction, we need to load the trained model into memory. This requires the model to be saved and serialized during the training process. Add the code to load the model inside the `sentiment_analysis` function:

```python
import joblib

@app.route('/sentiment-analysis', methods=['POST'])
def sentiment_analysis():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Retrieve the user input
    user_input = data['message']

    # Preprocess the user input (apply the same preprocessing steps used during training)
    preprocessed_input = preprocess_text(user_input)

    # Load the trained model
    model = joblib.load('path/to/trained/model.pkl')

    # Pass the preprocessed input to the trained model for sentiment prediction
    predicted_sentiment_label = model.predict([preprocessed_input])[0]

    # Return the

 predicted sentiment label as the API response
    response = {'sentiment': predicted_sentiment_label}
    return jsonify(response)
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/trained/model.pkl'` with the actual path to your trained model file.

## Step 5: Start the Flask application

Finally, we need to start the Flask application to run the API server. Add the following code at the end of your `app.py` file:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

## Step 6: Test the API endpoint

To test the API endpoint, you can use a tool like `curl` or send HTTP requests programmatically. Here's an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "I'm very satisfied with the customer support!"}' http://localhost:5000/sentiment-analysis
```

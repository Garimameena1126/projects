# Module 1: Data Preprocessing and Exploration

## Task: Gather a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails

In this task, we will gather a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails. Having a labeled dataset is essential for training a machine learning model to classify emails accurately. Let's go through the step-by-step process to acquire such a dataset.

### Step 1: Identify Potential Data Sources

To gather a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails, we need to identify potential data sources. There are various options to consider:

1. Publicly available datasets: Look for existing datasets that are freely accessible and labeled for spam detection tasks. Websites like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or the Enron email dataset can be good starting points.

2. Data collection: If a suitable dataset is not readily available, you can consider collecting your own labeled data. This can involve manually labeling emails as spam or non-spam. You can reach out to friends, colleagues, or online communities to request email samples for labeling purposes.

For this guide, let's assume that we will use a publicly available dataset from Kaggle called the "Spam or Ham" dataset.

### Step 2: Download the Dataset

In this step, we will download the "Spam or Ham" dataset from Kaggle. Follow these instructions:

1. Go to the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/) and sign in to your account. If you don't have an account, create one for free.

2. Search for the "Spam or Ham" dataset in the Kaggle search bar.

3. Choose the appropriate dataset from the search results and navigate to its page.

4. Download the dataset by clicking on the "Download" button or using the provided command if available.

### Step 3: Extract and Inspect the Dataset

After downloading the dataset, we need to extract it and inspect its contents. Follow these steps:

1. Locate the downloaded dataset file on your computer and extract its contents to a convenient location.

2. Once extracted, navigate to the dataset folder and explore its contents. Typically, the dataset may consist of one or more files containing email samples along with their corresponding labels.

3. Open one of the dataset files using a text editor or spreadsheet application to get a glimpse of the data structure. Make sure the file contains email samples and their corresponding labels (e.g., spam or non-spam).

### Step 4: Load the Dataset into a Programming Environment

To further process and analyze the dataset, we need to load it into a programming environment such as Python. We will assume you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred Python development environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, Visual Studio Code).

2. Create a new Python script or notebook.

3. Import the required libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

4. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame:

```python
# Replace 'path_to_dataset' with the actual path to the dataset file
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_dataset')
```

Ensure that you provide the correct path to the dataset file in the `read_csv` function.

### Step 5: Verify the Dataset

After loading the dataset, it's essential to verify its structure and check if it aligns with your expectations. Follow these steps:

1. Display the first few rows of the dataset to examine its contents:

```python
df.head()
```

2. Check the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns):

```python
df.shape
```

3. Inspect the column names:

```python
df.columns
```

4.

 Confirm if the dataset includes the necessary columns for email text and labels.

### Step 6: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before proceeding with the data exploration phase, it's important to perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for further analysis and modeling. Follow these steps:

1. Remove unnecessary characters, such as special symbols or punctuation marks, from the email text. You can use regular expressions or string manipulation functions to achieve this.

2. Convert the email text to lowercase to achieve case insensitivity. This helps in treating similar words with different cases as the same word during analysis.

3. Remove stop words from the email text. Stop words are commonly occurring words (e.g., "the," "is," "and") that typically do not contribute much to the classification task.

4. Perform additional preprocessing steps as per your requirements, such as stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text further.

Make sure to document the specific data cleaning and preprocessing steps performed for reproducibility.

### Step 7: Save the Preprocessed Dataset

After completing the data cleaning and preprocessing steps, it's a good practice to save the preprocessed dataset for future use. Follow these steps:

1. Specify a filename and path to save the preprocessed dataset:

```python
# Replace 'path_to_save' with the desired path and filename
preprocessed_filename = 'path_to_save'
```

2. Save the preprocessed dataset as a CSV file:

```python
df.to_csv(preprocessed_filename, index=False)
```

# Add Functionality to Edit or Delete Fitness Goals

In this task, we will focus on adding functionality to edit or delete fitness goals in the user dashboard. Users should be able to modify their existing fitness goals or remove them entirely. Let's go through the step-by-step guide to implement this feature.

## Step 1: Retrieve Fitness Goals

Before we can edit or delete fitness goals, we need to retrieve the user's existing goals from the database. Here's how you can do it:

1. In your server-side code (Node.js), create a new route or API endpoint that handles the retrieval of fitness goals.
2. When a user accesses this endpoint, query the database to fetch the goals associated with the current user.
3. Return the retrieved goals as a JSON response to the client.

Example code in Node.js using Express and MongoDB:

```javascript
// Assuming you have set up your Express app and connected to MongoDB

app.get('/api/goals', (req, res) => {
  // Assuming you have a 'goals' collection in your MongoDB database
  const goalsCollection = db.collection('goals');

  // Find goals associated with the current user (use the appropriate field to match the user)
  goalsCollection.find({ userId: req.user.id }).toArray((err, goals) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve goals' });
    }
    return res.json(goals);
  });
});
```

## Step 2: Display Goals in the User Dashboard

Now that we have retrieved the fitness goals, we need to display them in the user dashboard. Here's how you can achieve that:

1. In your client-side code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), create a section in the user dashboard to display the goals.
2. Make an AJAX request to the server-side endpoint we created in Step 1 (`/api/goals`) to fetch the goals.
3. Once the goals are received, dynamically generate HTML elements to represent each goal and append them to the goals section.

Example code in JavaScript using fetch API:

```javascript
// Assuming you have a DOM element to represent the goals section
const goalsSection = document.getElementById('goals-section');

fetch('/api/goals')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(goals => {
    // Clear existing goals in case of an update
    goalsSection.innerHTML = '';

    // Iterate over each goal and create HTML elements
    goals.forEach(goal => {
      const goalElement = document.createElement('div');
      goalElement.textContent = goal.name; // Modify this to display relevant goal details
      goalsSection.appendChild(goalElement);
    });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
    // Handle error case
  });
```

## Step 3: Implement Edit Functionality

To allow users to edit their fitness goals, we need to provide them with an interface to make changes. Here's how you can implement this:

1. In your user dashboard, add an "Edit" button or link next to each displayed goal.
2. When the user clicks the "Edit" button, present a form or dialog that allows them to modify the goal's details.
3. Pre-fill the form fields with the existing goal data so that the user can make necessary changes.
4. Capture the user's modifications and send them to the server-side for updating the goal in the database.
5. Handle any errors that may occur during the update process and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

Example code in JavaScript using event delegation:

```javascript
// Assuming you have a DOM element to represent the goals section
const goalsSection = document.getElementById('goals-section');

// Event delegation to capture clicks

 on the "Edit" buttons
goalsSection.addEventListener('click', event => {
  if (event.target.matches('.edit-button')) {
    const goalElement = event.target.closest('.goal');
    const goalId = goalElement.dataset.goalId; // Assuming you have a unique identifier for each goal

    // Present a form or dialog to the user with pre-filled data for editing
    // Capture the user's modifications and send them to the server-side for update
    // Handle any errors and provide feedback to the user
  }
});
```

## Step 4: Implement Delete Functionality

To allow users to delete their fitness goals, we need to provide them with an option to remove goals. Here's how you can implement this:

1. In your user dashboard, add a "Delete" button or link next to each displayed goal.
2. When the user clicks the "Delete" button, prompt them to confirm the deletion (to prevent accidental removal).
3. If the user confirms the deletion, send a request to the server-side to delete the goal from the database.
4. Handle any errors that may occur during the deletion process and provide appropriate feedback to the user.
5. Once the goal is successfully deleted, remove the corresponding HTML element representing the goal from the user dashboard.

Example code in JavaScript using event delegation:

```javascript
// Assuming you have a DOM element to represent the goals section
const goalsSection = document.getElementById('goals-section');

// Event delegation to capture clicks on the "Delete" buttons
goalsSection.addEventListener('click', event => {
  if (event.target.matches('.delete-button')) {
    const goalElement = event.target.closest('.goal');
    const goalId = goalElement.dataset.goalId; // Assuming you have a unique identifier for each goal

    // Prompt the user to confirm the deletion
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this goal?')) {
      // Send a request to the server-side to delete the goal
      fetch(`/api/goals/${goalId}`, { method: 'DELETE' })
        .then(response => {
          if (response.ok) {
            // If deletion is successful, remove the goal element from the user dashboard
            goalElement.remove();
          } else {
            throw new Error('Failed to delete goal');
          }
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.error(error);
          // Handle error case
        });
    }
  }
});
```

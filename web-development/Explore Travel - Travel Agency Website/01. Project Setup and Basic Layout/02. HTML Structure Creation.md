# Setting Up the Basic HTML Structure of the Website

In this guide, we will focus on setting up the basic HTML structure for our Travel Agency website. This task is part of "Module 1: Setup and Basic Layout" of the project.

## Step 1: Open the HTML File
1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor of your choice. This file is located inside the `pages` folder of your project.

## Step 2: Add the Doctype and HTML Tags
1. Add the following code at the beginning of the `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
```

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifies the HTML version, and the `<html>` tag represents the root element of the HTML document. The `lang="en"` attribute sets the language to English.

## Step 3: Add the Head Section
1. Inside the `<html>` tags, add the following code:

```html
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Travel Agency</title>
</head>
```

Let's break down the code:

- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: This meta tag sets the character encoding to UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This meta tag sets the viewport properties for responsive design, ensuring the website adapts well to different devices.
- `<title>Travel Agency</title>`: This is the title of your webpage, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar.

## Step 4: Add the Body Section
1. Below the `</head>` tag, add the opening and closing `<body>` tags:

```html
<body>
    
</body>
```

The `<body>` tags enclose the visible content of your webpage.

## Step 5: Save the Changes and Review
1. Save the changes made to the `index.html` file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to review the basic HTML structure.

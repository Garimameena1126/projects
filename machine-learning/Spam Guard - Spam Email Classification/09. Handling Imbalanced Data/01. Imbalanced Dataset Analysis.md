# Handling Imbalanced Data in Email Classification

In this guide, we will explore techniques to handle imbalanced data in the email classification task. Imbalanced data refers to a situation where the number of samples in one class is significantly higher or lower than the number of samples in the other class. This can pose challenges for machine learning models as they tend to favor the majority class and perform poorly on the minority class. To address this issue, we will investigate oversampling and undersampling methods and evaluate the performance of the model with both the imbalanced and balanced datasets.

## 1. Understanding Imbalanced Data

Before we dive into handling imbalanced data, let's understand the concept and challenges associated with imbalanced datasets. In our email classification task, we have two classes: spam and non-spam. Imbalanced data occurs when the number of spam emails is significantly different from the number of non-spam emails. For example, if we have 90% non-spam emails and only 10% spam emails, the dataset is imbalanced.

Imbalanced datasets can lead to biased models because the model tends to favor the majority class. This can result in poor performance on the minority class, which in our case is spam emails. To address this issue, we need to balance the dataset by either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class.

## 2. Investigating Oversampling Methods

Oversampling involves increasing the number of samples in the minority class to match the number of samples in the majority class. This helps the model to learn from more balanced data and improve its ability to classify the minority class correctly. Let's explore a popular oversampling method called Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

### 2.1 Understanding SMOTE

SMOTE is a widely used oversampling technique that generates synthetic samples for the minority class. It creates new synthetic samples by interpolating between existing samples. The basic steps of SMOTE are as follows:

1. Select a sample from the minority class.
2. Find its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
3. Randomly select one of the k nearest neighbors.
4. Generate a synthetic sample by interpolating between the selected sample and the randomly selected neighbor.

SMOTE can be implemented using the `imbalanced-learn` library, which provides a variety of techniques for handling imbalanced data.

### 2.2 Implementing SMOTE

To implement SMOTE for our email classification task, follow these steps:

#### 2.2.1 Install the required libraries

```shell
pip install imbalanced-learn
```

#### 2.2.2 Import the necessary libraries

```python
import numpy as np
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
```

#### 2.2.3 Perform SMOTE oversampling

Assuming you have the following data and labels:

```python
# Assuming 'X' contains the feature matrix and 'y' contains the corresponding labels
X = ...
y = ...
```

Apply SMOTE oversampling as shown below:

```python
# Create an instance of SMOTE
smote = SMOTE()

# Perform SMOTE oversampling
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
```

In the code above, `fit_resample()` is used to perform SMOTE oversampling on the feature matrix `X` and corresponding labels `y`. It returns the oversampled feature matrix `X_resampled` and the corresponding oversampled labels `y_resampled`.

## 3. Investigating Undersampling Methods

Undersampling involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to match the number of samples in the minority class. This helps to create a more balanced dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. Let's explore an undersampling method called Random Under-Sampling.

### 3.1 Understanding Random Under-Sampling

Random Under-Sampling randomly selects a subset of samples from the majority class to match the number of samples in the minority class. This approach can be effective when the majority class has a large number of redundant samples.

### 3.2 Implementing Random Under-Sampling

To implement Random Under-Sampling for our email classification task, follow these steps:

#### 3.2.1 Import the necessary libraries

```python
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler
```

#### 3.2.2 Perform Random Under-Sampling

Assuming you have the following data and labels:

```python
# Assuming 'X' contains the feature matrix and 'y' contains the corresponding labels
X = ...
y = ...
```

Apply Random Under-Sampling as shown below:

```python
# Create an instance of RandomUnderSampler
rus = RandomUnderSampler()

# Perform Random Under-Sampling
X_resampled, y_resampled = rus.fit_resample(X, y)
```

In the code above, `fit_resample()` is used to perform Random Under-Sampling on the feature matrix `X` and corresponding labels `y`. It returns the undersampled feature matrix `X_resampled` and the corresponding undersampled labels `y_resampled`.

## 4. Evaluating Model Performance

Once we have balanced the dataset using either oversampling or undersampling, it's important to evaluate the performance of our model on the balanced dataset. This will help us determine if the handling of imbalanced data has improved the model's ability to classify spam and non-spam emails accurately.

To evaluate the model's performance, we can use various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, we can plot the confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance on both classes.

Implement the evaluation metrics and the confusion matrix to assess the model's performance on the balanced dataset.

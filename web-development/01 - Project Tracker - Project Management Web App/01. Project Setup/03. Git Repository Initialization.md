In this guide, we will walk through the process of setting up a new Git repository for the project management app and making an initial commit. This will allow us to track changes to our code and collaborate with others effectively.

### Step 1: Open the Project Folder

Open the project folder "project-management-app" in your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code. This is the folder where you will initialize the Git repository.

### Step 2: Open the Integrated Terminal

In your code editor, open the integrated terminal. This terminal will allow you to execute Git commands directly within the editor.

### Step 3: Initialize a New Git Repository

In the terminal, execute the following command to initialize a new Git repository in the project folder:

```shell
git init
```

This command initializes an empty Git repository in the project folder, creating the necessary hidden ".git" directory.

### Step 4: Verify the Git Initialization

After executing the command, you should see a message indicating that the Git repository was successfully initialized. You can also check for the presence of the ".git" directory in the project folder to confirm.

### Step 5: Stage the Files

Before making an initial commit, we need to stage the files that we want to include in the commit. To stage all the files in the project folder, execute the following command:

```shell
git add .
```

This command adds all the files in the current directory and its subdirectories to the staging area.

### Step 6: Make an Initial Commit

To make an initial commit with a descriptive message, execute the following command:

```shell
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Replace "Initial commit" with a meaningful message that describes the purpose of the commit. This message will help you understand the changes made in the future.

### Step 7: Verify the Initial Commit

After executing the commit command, you should see a message indicating that the commit was successfully created. Additionally, you can use the following command to view the commit history:

```shell
git log
```

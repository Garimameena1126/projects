# Implement Email Templates for Booking Confirmation and Updates

In this guide, we will walk through the process of implementing email templates for booking confirmation and updates in your project. Email templates provide a consistent and professional look for your automated emails. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create the Email Templates

First, we need to create the email templates for booking confirmation and updates. These templates will be used as the basis for the content of the emails sent to users.

1. Decide on the structure and content of your email templates. Consider including elements such as a header, logo, dynamic content placeholders, and a footer.

2. Create separate HTML files for each email template. For example, you could create files named `booking_confirmation.html` and `booking_update.html`.

3. Open each HTML file and add the necessary HTML markup for your email templates. You can use HTML tags and CSS styles to customize the appearance of the emails.

4. To make the email templates dynamic, use placeholders that will be replaced with actual content when the emails are sent. For example, you could use placeholders like `{{username}}` or `{{booking_details}}`.

Here's an example of a simple email template for booking confirmation:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      /* Add CSS styles here to customize the appearance of the email */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <!-- Add header content here -->
    </header>

    <main>
      <h1>Booking Confirmation</h1>
      <p>Hello, {{username}}!</p>
      <p>Your booking for {{booking_details}} has been confirmed.</p>
    </main>

    <footer>
      <!-- Add footer content here -->
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Step 2: Integrate the Email Templates

Now that we have our email templates ready, let's integrate them into our project.

1. Store the email templates in a directory within your project. For example, you could create a folder named `email_templates` and place the template files inside it.

2. Create a function in your codebase that will load and render the email templates. This function will be responsible for replacing the placeholders in the templates with the actual content.

   Here's an example in JavaScript using Node.js:

   ```javascript
   function renderEmailTemplate(templatePath, data) {
     const template = fs.readFileSync(templatePath, 'utf8');

     // Replace placeholders with actual content
     let renderedTemplate = template.replace(/{{(\w+)}}/g, (match, key) => {
       return data[key] || '';
     });

     return renderedTemplate;
   }
   ```

   In this example, `templatePath` is the path to the HTML file of the email template, and `data` is an object containing the dynamic content values.

## Step 3: Sending Emails with Templates

With the email templates integrated into your project, you can now send emails using these templates.

1. Use your email delivery service's API or library to send emails. Refer to the documentation of the email delivery service you set up in a previous step for instructions on how to send emails.

2. Load the appropriate email template using the `renderEmailTemplate` function we created earlier. Pass in the template file path and the dynamic content values.

3. Set the loaded and rendered email template as the HTML content of your email.

4. Send the email to the recipient(s) using the email delivery service's API or library.

Here's an example using the SendGrid library in Node.js:

```javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey('YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY');

function sendBookingConfirmationEmail(rec

ipient, bookingDetails) {
  const templatePath = './email_templates/booking_confirmation.html';
  const emailContent = renderEmailTemplate(templatePath, {
    username: recipient.name,
    booking_details: bookingDetails,
  });

  const msg = {
    to: recipient.email,
    from: 'your-email@example.com',
    subject: 'Booking Confirmation',
    html: emailContent,
  };

  sgMail.send(msg)
    .then(() => {
      console.log('Booking confirmation email sent successfully!');
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error sending booking confirmation email:', error);
    });
}
```

Remember to replace `'YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY'` with your actual SendGrid API key and `'your-email@example.com'` with your email address.

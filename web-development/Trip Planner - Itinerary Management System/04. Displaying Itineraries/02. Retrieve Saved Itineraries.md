## Retrieving Saved Itineraries from Local Storage

In this guide, we will learn how to retrieve the saved itineraries from local storage in our project. We will use the `localStorage` API to store and retrieve data. By retrieving the saved itineraries, we can display them in our application.

### Step 1: Retrieve Saved Itineraries from Local Storage

1. Open your JavaScript file (e.g., `app.js`) in a text editor or IDE.
2. Identify the appropriate place in your code where you want to retrieve the saved itineraries, such as when the application initializes or when a specific event occurs.
3. Use the `localStorage` API to retrieve the saved itineraries from the local storage.
4. Parse the retrieved data from a string format (JSON) back into JavaScript objects using `JSON.parse()`.

```javascript
// Retrieve saved itineraries from local storage
const savedItineraries = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('itineraries')) || [];
```

In the above code:
- `localStorage.getItem('itineraries')` retrieves the value stored in the local storage with the key `'itineraries'`.
- `JSON.parse()` converts the retrieved JSON string back into an array of objects.
- The `|| []` part ensures that if there are no saved itineraries or the retrieval fails, an empty array is assigned to `savedItineraries`.

### Step 2: Use the Retrieved Itineraries in Your Application

1. Once you have retrieved the saved itineraries, you can use them to display or manipulate the data in your application.
2. You can pass the `savedItineraries` array to other functions or use it directly in your code to perform operations such as generating HTML elements or updating the user interface.

```javascript
function displayItineraries(itineraries) {
  // Your code to display the itineraries
}

displayItineraries(savedItineraries);
```

In the above example, the `displayItineraries` function is called with the `savedItineraries` array as an argument to display the itineraries in the user interface.

### Step 3: Test Retrieval of Saved Itineraries

1. Save your JavaScript file.
2. Ensure that you have previously saved itineraries in the local storage.
3. Load your application in a web browser.
4. Verify that the saved itineraries are retrieved successfully and that you can use them in your application as intended.

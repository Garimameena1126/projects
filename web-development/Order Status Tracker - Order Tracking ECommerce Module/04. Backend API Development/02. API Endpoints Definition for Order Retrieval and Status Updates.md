# Defining API Endpoints for Order Details and Status Updates

In this task, we will define API endpoints for retrieving order details and updating the order status. These endpoints will allow the frontend to communicate with the backend and perform necessary operations related to order information. Follow the steps below to define the API endpoints.

## Step 1: Set up the Project

1. Ensure that you have already set up a server using a backend framework like Node.js with Express. If not, refer to the previous guide for setting up the server.

## Step 2: Create a New File for API Routes

1. In your project directory, create a new directory called `routes`.
2. Inside the `routes` directory, create a new file called `orderRoutes.js`. This file will contain the API routes related to order operations.

## Step 3: Define the API Routes

1. Open the `orderRoutes.js` file in a text editor or code editor of your choice.

2. In the `orderRoutes.js` file, import the necessary modules and create a router instance:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const router = express.Router();
   ```

3. Define the route for retrieving order details:

   ```javascript
   // GET /api/orders/:orderId
   router.get('/:orderId', (req, res) => {
     // Retrieve the order details based on the orderId parameter
     const orderId = req.params.orderId;
     // Logic to fetch the order details from the database or any other data source
     // Replace the following example code with your actual implementation
     const order = {
       id: orderId,
       customerName: 'John Doe',
       // Other order details
     };
     // Send the order details as the response
     res.json(order);
   });
   ```

   In this example, the route `/api/orders/:orderId` is defined using the `GET` method. The `orderId` parameter in the URL represents the unique identifier of the order. You can replace the example logic with your actual implementation to retrieve the order details from the database or any other data source.

4. Define the route for updating the order status:

   ```javascript
   // PUT /api/orders/:orderId/status
   router.put('/:orderId/status', (req, res) => {
     // Retrieve the order ID and updated status from the request body
     const orderId = req.params.orderId;
     const { status } = req.body;
     // Logic to update the order status in the database or any other data source
     // Replace the following example code with your actual implementation
     // Note: This example assumes a successful update
     const updatedOrder = {
       id: orderId,
       status: status,
     };
     // Send the updated order as the response
     res.json(updatedOrder);
   });
   ```

   In this example, the route `/api/orders/:orderId/status` is defined using the `PUT` method. The `orderId` parameter in the URL represents the unique identifier of the order. The updated order status is expected in the request body. Again, you can replace the example logic with your actual implementation to update the order status in the database or any other data source.

5. Export the router to make it available for use in other files:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = router;
   ```

## Step 4: Connect the API Routes to the Server

1. Open the server file (e.g., `server.js`) that you created earlier.
2. Import the `orderRoutes.js` file and connect the API routes to the server:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Import the order routes
   const orderRoutes = require('./routes/orderRoutes');

   // Use the order routes
   app.use('/api/orders', orderRoutes);

   // Start the server
   const port = 3000;
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

   In this code, we import the `orderRoutes` from the `orderRoutes.js` file and use them with the prefix `/api/orders`. This means that the order-related API routes will be accessible under the `/api/orders` URL path.

## Step 5: Test the API Endpoints

1. Ensure that your server is running. If not, start it using the appropriate command (e.g., `node server.js`).
2. Use a tool like Postman or a web browser to send HTTP requests to the defined API endpoints:
   - To retrieve order details, send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/orders/{orderId}` (replace `{orderId}` with an actual order ID).
   - To update the order status, send a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:3000/api/orders/{orderId}/status` (replace `{orderId}` with an actual order ID) and include the updated status in the request body.
3. Verify that the API endpoints return the expected responses based on your implementation.

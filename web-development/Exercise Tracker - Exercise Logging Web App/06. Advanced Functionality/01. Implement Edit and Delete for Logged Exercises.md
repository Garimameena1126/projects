# Task: Implement the Ability to Edit and Delete Logged Exercises

In this task, we will focus on implementing the ability to edit and delete logged exercises in our application. Users should be able to modify the details of an existing exercise entry or remove it from their exercise log.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step guide to implement this functionality.

## Step 1: Update the Exercise Model

1. Open the file where the exercise model is defined (e.g., `exercise.js`).

2. Add the necessary fields to support editing and deleting exercises. For example, you might want to include an `id` field to uniquely identify each exercise entry.

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const exerciseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     userId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
     name: { type: String, required: true },
     duration: { type: Number, required: true },
     calories: { type: Number, required: true },
     date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
     // Add an id field for identification
     id: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, required: true, unique: true }
   });

   module.exports = mongoose.model('Exercise', exerciseSchema);
   ```

   Make sure to update the schema definition according to your application's requirements.

## Step 2: Create API Endpoints for Editing and Deleting Exercises

1. Open the file where you define your exercise-related API endpoints (e.g., `exerciseRoutes.js`).

2. Implement a route to handle the editing of an exercise. This route should receive the updated exercise details and the exercise ID as parameters.

   ```javascript
   router.put('/exercises/:id', async (req, res) => {
     const { name, duration, calories, date } = req.body;
     const exerciseId = req.params.id;

     try {
       // Find the exercise by its ID and update its fields
       const exercise = await Exercise.findByIdAndUpdate(
         exerciseId,
         { name, duration, calories, date },
         { new: true }
       );

       res.json(exercise);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to update the exercise' });
     }
   });
   ```

3. Implement a route to handle the deletion of an exercise. This route should receive the exercise ID as a parameter.

   ```javascript
   router.delete('/exercises/:id', async (req, res) => {
     const exerciseId = req.params.id;

     try {
       // Find the exercise by its ID and remove it
       await Exercise.findByIdAndDelete(exerciseId);

       res.json({ message: 'Exercise deleted successfully' });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to delete the exercise' });
     }
   });
   ```

   These routes use the `Exercise` model to find the corresponding exercise entry by its ID and perform the necessary update or deletion.

## Step 3: Update the Client-Side Application

1. Open the file where the client-side code for exercise editing and deletion is implemented (e.g., `ExerciseEdit.js`).

2. Implement the logic to retrieve the exercise details and allow users to modify them.

   ```javascript
   // Example code snippet for editing exercise
   function editExercise(exerciseId, updatedExercise) {
     // Make an API request to update the exercise
     axios.put(`/exercises/${exerciseId}`, updatedExercise)
       .then((response) => {
         // Handle the response and update the UI accordingly
         console.log(response.data);
      

 })
       .catch((error) => {
         // Handle error scenarios
         console.error(error);
       });
   }
   ```

3. Implement the logic to delete an exercise entry.

   ```javascript
   // Example code snippet for deleting exercise
   function deleteExercise(exerciseId) {
     // Make an API request to delete the exercise
     axios.delete(`/exercises/${exerciseId}`)
       .then((response) => {
         // Handle the response and update the UI accordingly
         console.log(response.data);
       })
       .catch((error) => {
         // Handle error scenarios
         console.error(error);
       });
   }
   ```

   These code snippets demonstrate making API requests to the server to update or delete an exercise based on its ID.

4. Integrate the edit and delete functionality into your user interface. For example, you might add an "Edit" button next to each exercise entry that opens a form for editing, and a "Delete" button to remove the exercise entry.

   ```javascript
   // Example code snippet for rendering exercise list with edit and delete buttons
   function renderExerciseList(exercises) {
     return (
       <ul>
         {exercises.map((exercise) => (
           <li key={exercise.id}>
             <span>{exercise.name}</span>
             <button onClick={() => editExercise(exercise.id, updatedExercise)}>Edit</button>
             <button onClick={() => deleteExercise(exercise.id)}>Delete</button>
           </li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     );
   }
   ```

   Customize the UI implementation to match your application's design and requirements.

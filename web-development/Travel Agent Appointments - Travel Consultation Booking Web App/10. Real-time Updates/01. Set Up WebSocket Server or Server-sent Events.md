1. **Choose a server-side technology**: Determine which server-side technology you will use to implement real-time updates. WebSocket and server-sent events are supported in different programming languages and frameworks. Choose the one that best aligns with your project's requirements and familiarity.

2. **Install necessary dependencies**: If you're using a framework or library, install the required dependencies. This step may vary depending on the technology you choose. Refer to the official documentation or community resources for guidance on installing the necessary packages.

3. **Create a server file**: Create a new file or modify an existing server file to handle WebSocket connections or server-sent events. This file will serve as your WebSocket server or server-sent events implementation.

4. **Set up the server**: Configure your server to listen for WebSocket connections or server-sent events. This step also depends on the chosen server-side technology. Here's a general example using Node.js and the `ws` library for WebSocket:

   ```javascript
   const WebSocket = require('ws');
   const server = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

   server.on('connection', (socket) => {
     // Handle WebSocket connections
   });
   ```

   For server-sent events, the server setup will differ based on the technology you're using. Consult the documentation for the specific implementation details.

5. **Handle WebSocket connections or server-sent events**: Implement the logic to handle WebSocket connections or server-sent events. This involves listening for events and performing actions when data is received or when the connection is closed. Here's an example of handling WebSocket connections:

   ```javascript
   server.on('connection', (socket) => {
     socket.on('message', (data) => {
       // Handle received data from the client
     });

     socket.on('close', () => {
       // Handle connection closure
     });
   });
   ```

   For server-sent events, the event names and event handlers will vary depending on the technology you're using.

6. **Emit updates from the server**: When changes occur in the database that require real-time updates, emit events or messages from the server to the connected clients. This step is specific to your application's logic and data flow. Here's an example of emitting a WebSocket message:

   ```javascript
   server.on('connection', (socket) => {
     // Emit an update to the connected client
     socket.send('New time slot available');
   });
   ```

   For server-sent events, the method of sending updates will be different. Refer to the specific technology's documentation for the appropriate approach.

7. **Update the client-side UI in real-time**: On the client-side, establish a connection to the WebSocket server or server-sent events endpoint. Receive and process the updates sent from the server. Update the UI of your application accordingly. Here's an example of establishing a WebSocket connection in JavaScript:

   ```javascript
   const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

   socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
     // Handle received message from the server
     const data = event.data;
     // Update the UI based on the received data
   });
   ```

   For server-sent events, the client-side implementation will differ. Refer to the specific technology's documentation for the appropriate client-side code.

8. **Test and refine**: Start your server and test the real-time updates functionality. Verify that the client-side UI updates as expected when new time slots become available or existing time slots are
removed. Make any necessary refinements or bug fixes to ensure the desired real-time behavior.

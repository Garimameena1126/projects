# Creating a New Project Folder and Setting Up Files and Folders

In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating a new project folder and setting up the necessary files and folders for our web development project. This task is part of the "Module 1: Setup and Basic Layout" of our Travel Agency website project.

## Step 1: Choose a Project Name
Choose a suitable name for your project. This will be used as the folder name and should be descriptive and relevant to your project. For example, let's use the name "travel-agency-website".

## Step 2: Create a New Project Folder
1. Open your preferred file explorer or terminal.
2. Navigate to the location where you want to create the project folder.
3. Right-click (or use the terminal command) and select "New Folder" or use the command `mkdir travel-agency-website` to create a new folder with the chosen project name.

## Step 3: Set Up Files and Folders Structure
1. Open the newly created project folder in your file explorer or terminal.
2. Inside the project folder, create the following folders:

   - `css`: This folder will contain CSS files for styling your website.
   - `js`: This folder will contain JavaScript files for adding interactivity to your website.
   - `images`: This folder will store the images used in your website.
   - `pages`: This folder will store individual HTML files for different pages of your website.
   - `assets`: This folder can be used to store any additional assets like fonts, icons, or videos that your website may require.

   Your project folder structure should now look like this:

   ```
   travel-agency-website
   ├── css
   ├── js
   ├── images
   ├── pages
   └── assets
   ```

## Step 4: Create HTML File
1. Inside the `pages` folder, create a new file called `index.html`. This will be the main HTML file for your website's homepage.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor of your choice.

## Step 5: Set Up Basic HTML Structure
1. In the `index.html` file, start by adding the basic HTML structure. Type the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Travel Agency Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/style.css">
    <script src="../js/main.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

Let's break down the code:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration specifies the version of HTML being used.
- `<html lang="en">`: This tag indicates that the content is written in English.
- `<head>`: This section contains meta information, CSS and JavaScript file references, and the webpage title.
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: This meta tag sets the character encoding to UTF-8.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This meta tag sets the viewport properties for responsive design.
- `<title>Travel Agency Website</title>`: This is the title of your webpage displayed in the browser's title bar.
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/style.css">`: This link tag references the CSS file for styling the webpage. The `../` indicates the parent directory.
- `<script src="../js/main.js"></script>`: This script tag references the JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the webpage. Again

, the `../` indicates the parent directory.
- `<body>`: This section contains the visible content of your webpage.

## Step 6: Create Navigation Bar
1. Inside the `<body>` tags of the `index.html` file, add the following code to create a navigation bar:

```html
<header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Destinations</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Packages</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Experiences</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About Us</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>
```

The code above creates a `<header>` section with a navigation bar (`<nav>`) containing an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`) and anchor links (`<a>`) for each navigation item. Replace the "#" with the actual links once they are created.

## Step 7: Add Header Section
1. Below the navigation bar, add the following code to create the header section:

```html
<section class="hero">
    <h1>Welcome to Travel Agency</h1>
    <p>Discover Your Dream Destinations</p>
</section>
```

The code above creates a `<section>` element with a class of "hero". Inside the section, there is an `<h1>` heading for the catchy title and a `<p>` element for the description. You can customize the text to fit your desired header content.

## Step 8: Create Footer Section
1. At the end of the `index.html` file, add the following code to create the footer section:

```html
<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2023 Travel Agency. All rights reserved.</p>
</footer>
```

The code above creates a `<footer>` section with a `<p>` element containing the copyright information.

## Step 9: Save and Review
1. Save the changes made to the `index.html` file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to review the basic layout of your webpage. You should see the navigation bar, header section, and footer section.

# Step-by-Step Guide: Adding Input Fields for Exercise Name, Sets, and Reps

In this task, we will enhance the exercise logging form by adding input fields for exercise name, sets, and reps. These fields will allow users to enter the details of their exercise sessions accurately. We will follow a step-by-step approach to implement this feature.

## Prerequisites

- HTML knowledge
- Code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed

## Steps

1. **Open Code Editor**

   Launch your preferred code editor or IDE.

2. **Open the HTML File**

   Open the `index.html` file that you created earlier in your code editor.

3. **Locate the Form Element**

   Inside the `<form>` element, identify the position where you want to add the input fields. Typically, this would be below the existing form elements.

4. **Add Exercise Name Input Field**

   Add the following code to create an input field for the exercise name:

   ```html
   <label for="exercise-name">Exercise Name:</label>
   <input type="text" id="exercise-name" name="exercise-name" required>
   ```

   The `<label>` element provides a text description for the input field, while the `<input>` element creates the actual input field. The `id` attribute uniquely identifies the input field, and the `name` attribute associates it with a specific form field. The `required` attribute ensures that the user must enter a value in this field before submitting the form.

5. **Add Sets Input Field**

   Following a similar approach, add the code for the sets input field:

   ```html
   <label for="sets">Sets:</label>
   <input type="number" id="sets" name="sets" required>
   ```

   This code creates an input field for the sets, allowing users to enter the number of sets they performed during their exercise session.

6. **Add Reps Input Field**

   Finally, add the code for the reps input field:

   ```html
   <label for="reps">Reps:</label>
   <input type="number" id="reps" name="reps" required>
   ```

   This code creates an input field for the reps, enabling users to input the number of repetitions they completed for each set.

7. **Preview the Form**

   Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see a preview of the exercise logging form. You should now have input fields for exercise name, sets, and reps.

8. **Style the Input Fields (Optional)**

   If desired, you can apply CSS styles to the input fields to enhance their appearance. Open the `styles.css` file and add appropriate CSS rules to customize the look and feel of the input fields.

## Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully added input fields for exercise name, sets, and reps to the exercise logging form. Users can now enter the details of their workout sessions using these fields. Remember to follow the provided guidelines while writing the guide to ensure it remains beginner-friendly and structured.

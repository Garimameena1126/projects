To build a machine learning model for predicting flight prices, we need a dataset containing historical flight data. In this guide, we will gather the necessary data by utilizing an API and store it in a structured format for further analysis.

### Step 1: Choose a Flight Data API

There are several APIs available that provide historical flight data. For this guide, we will use the OpenSky Network API, which offers a comprehensive set of flight-related information. You'll need to sign up for an API key to access the data.

### Step 2: Set Up the Project Environment

Before we begin coding, let's set up the project environment. Follow these steps:

1. Install Python: If you haven't already, install Python on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Python website and follow the installation instructions.

2. Create a Virtual Environment: It's good practice to work within a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new virtual environment named `flight-data`:

   ```
   python -m venv flight-data
   ```

3. Activate the Virtual Environment: Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command for your operating system:

   - On Windows:

     ```
     flight-data\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source flight-data/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install Required Packages: Install the necessary Python packages by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install requests pandas
   ```

### Step 3: Fetch Flight Data using the API

Now, let's write the code to fetch historical flight data using the OpenSky Network API. Open your favorite code editor and create a new Python script named `flight_data_collection.py`. Then, follow these steps:

1. Import the Required Libraries:

   ```python
   import requests
   import pandas as pd
   ```

2. Define the API Endpoint and Parameters:

   ```python
   api_url = 'https://api.opensky-network.org/flights'
   parameters = {
       'begin': '1609459200',  # Specify the start timestamp (e.g., January 1, 2021)
       'end': '1612137600',    # Specify the end timestamp (e.g., February 1, 2021)
       'bbox': '2.0,49.5,6.2,51.8'  # Specify the bounding box coordinates (e.g., Germany)
   }
   ```

   Adjust the timestamps and bounding box coordinates according to your desired data collection criteria.

3. Make the API Request and Retrieve the Flight Data:

   ```python
   response = requests.get(api_url, params=parameters)
   if response.status_code == 200:
       flight_data = response.json()
   else:
       print('Error:', response.status_code)
       flight_data = []
   ```

4. Convert the Flight Data to a DataFrame:

   ```python
   df = pd.DataFrame(flight_data)
   ```

5. Save the Flight Data to a CSV File:

   ```python
   df.to_csv('flight_data.csv', index=False)
   ```

   This will save the flight data to a file named `flight_data.csv` in the current directory.

### Step 4: Explore the Flight Data

Now that we have collected the flight data, let's explore its structure, variables, and possible relationships. Add the following code snippet to your `flight_data_collection.py` script:

```python
# Load the flight data from the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('flight_data.csv')

# Print the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())

# Get basic statistical information about the dataset
print(df.describe())

# Check the data types of each column
print(df.dtypes)

# Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks as needed
# - Examine the distribution of flight prices
# - Identify any missing values or outliers
# - Visualize relationships between variables
# - etc.
```

This code snippet loads the flight data from the CSV file and performs initial exploration tasks. Modify and add additional code to suit your specific dataset and analysis requirements.

### Step 5: Run the Data Collection Script

To execute the data collection script, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

```
python flight_data_collection.py
```

This will initiate the API request, fetch the flight data, save it to a CSV file, and provide exploratory insights into the dataset.

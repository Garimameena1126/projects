1. Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Create a new folder for your project. Choose a meaningful name for the folder that represents your project.

3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the location where you want to create the project folder. You can use the `cd` command followed by the path to change directories.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/parent/folder
   ```

4. Once you are in the desired location, create a new project folder using the `mkdir` command followed by the name of the folder.

   ```bash
   mkdir my-project
   ```

5. Change into the newly created project folder using the `cd` command.

   ```bash
   cd my-project
   ```

6. Now that you are inside the project folder, initialize Git by running the `git init` command. This command sets up a new Git repository in the current directory.

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

7. Verify that Git has been successfully initialized by checking for the presence of a hidden `.git` folder in the project directory. You can use the `ls -a` command to display hidden files and folders.

   ```bash
   ls -a
   ```

   If Git has been initialized correctly, you should see the `.git` folder listed.

8. Optionally, you can create a `.gitignore` file to specify files and directories that Git should ignore. This file is useful for excluding sensitive information or generated files from being tracked by Git.

   ```bash
   touch .gitignore
   ```

9. Open the `.gitignore` file in your text editor and add any files or directories that you want Git to ignore. For example, you might want to exclude the `node_modules` directory or `.env` files.

   ```plaintext
   # Ignore node_modules directory
   node_modules/

   # Ignore .env files
   .env
   ```

10. Save the `.gitignore` file.

11. At this point, you can start developing your web application within the project folder. Git is now initialized and ready to track changes in your project.

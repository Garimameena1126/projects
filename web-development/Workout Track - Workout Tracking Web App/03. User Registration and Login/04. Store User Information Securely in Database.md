
# Store User Information Securely in a Database

In this task, we will focus on storing user information securely in a database. Storing user data in a database allows us to persistently store and retrieve user information when needed. Follow the step-by-step guide below to accomplish this task.

## Step 1: Choose a Database Management System

Before we can store user information, we need to choose a suitable database management system (DBMS) for our project. Popular choices include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite. For the purpose of this guide, we will use MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

## Step 2: Install MongoDB

To install MongoDB, follow the instructions for your operating system:

### For Windows:

1. Visit the MongoDB download page at [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

2. Download the MSI package for your Windows version.

3. Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install MongoDB.

### For macOS:

1. Visit the MongoDB download page at [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

2. Download the .tgz package for macOS.

3. Extract the downloaded archive.

4. Rename the extracted folder to "mongodb".

5. Move the "mongodb" folder to the desired location on your system.

### For Linux:

1. Visit the MongoDB download page at [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

2. Select the appropriate Linux distribution and version.

3. Follow the instructions provided to install MongoDB on your Linux system.

For detailed installation instructions, refer to the MongoDB documentation specific to your operating system.

## Step 3: Start MongoDB Server

Once MongoDB is installed, we need to start the MongoDB server. Follow the steps below:

### For Windows:

1. Open a command prompt as an administrator.

2. Navigate to the MongoDB installation directory. For example:

   ```plaintext
   cd C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{version}\bin
   ```

3. Start the MongoDB server by running the following command:

   ```plaintext
   mongod.exe --dbpath C:\data\db
   ```

### For macOS and Linux:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the MongoDB installation directory. For example:

   ```plaintext
   cd /path/to/mongodb/bin
   ```

3. Start the MongoDB server by running the following command:

   ```plaintext
   ./mongod --dbpath /path/to/data/db
   ```

## Step 4: Connect to MongoDB Server

After starting the MongoDB server, we need to connect to it using a MongoDB client. In this guide, we will use the MongoDB shell. Follow the steps below to connect to the MongoDB server:

### For Windows, macOS, and Linux:

1. Open a new terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command to start the MongoDB shell:

   ```plaintext
   mongo
   ```

This will connect you to the default MongoDB server running on your local machine.

## Step 5: Create a Database

In the MongoDB shell, we will create a new database to store user information. Follow the steps below:

1. To create a new database, use the `use` command followed by the desired database name. For example, to create a database named "userdb", run the following command:

   ```plaintext
   use userdb
   ```

   If the database already exists, the command will switch to that database.

2. Verify that you are using the correct database by running the following command:

   ```plaintext
   db


   ```

   The shell should display the name of the current database.

## Step 6: Create a Collection

In MongoDB, a collection is a group of documents (similar to a table in a relational database). We will create a collection to store user information. Follow the steps below:

1. To create a new collection, use the `db.createCollection()` method followed by the desired collection name. For example, to create a collection named "users", run the following command:

   ```plaintext
   db.createCollection("users")
   ```

2. Verify that the collection was created by running the following command:

   ```plaintext
   show collections
   ```

   The shell should display the list of collections in the current database, and "users" should be among them.

## Step 7: Define a Schema for User Information

Before storing user information in the database, it's helpful to define a schema or structure for the data. This allows us to enforce data validation and maintain consistency. In this guide, we will use the Mongoose library to define the schema.

1. Install the Mongoose library by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```plaintext
   npm install mongoose
   ```

2. Create a new file named `userModel.js` in your project's `src` directory.

3. In the `userModel.js` file, import the Mongoose library and define the user schema. Add the following code:

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     },
     email: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
       unique: true
     },
     password: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     }
   });

   const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

   module.exports = User;
   ```

   This code defines a schema with three fields: `name`, `email`, and `password`. The fields are of type `String` and have validation rules specified.

4. Save the `userModel.js` file.

## Step 8: Store User Information in the Database

Now that we have a schema defined, we can store user information in the database. Follow the steps below:

1. In your project's file where user registration is handled (e.g., `register.js`), import the User model from the `userModel.js` file:

   ```javascript
   const User = require('./src/userModel');
   ```

2. When a new user registers, create a new instance of the User model and save it to the database. For example:

   ```javascript
   // Assuming req.body contains the user's name, email, and password
   const newUser = new User({
     name: req.body.name,
     email: req.body.email,
     password: req.body.password
   });

   newUser.save((err) => {
     if (err) {
       console.error(err);
       // Handle error
     } else {
       // User registration successful
     }
   });
   ```

   This code creates a new instance of the User model with the user's information and saves it to the database using the `save()` method.

**Module 2: Text Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**

**Task: Stopword Removal and Lowercasing**

In this task, we will focus on preprocessing the text data by removing unnecessary words known as "stopwords" and converting the text to lowercase. This step is essential to reduce noise in the data and improve the performance of our sentiment analysis model. We will use Python and some popular libraries such as NLTK and scikit-learn to accomplish this task.

Let's get started with the step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Import the Required Libraries
First, we need to import the necessary libraries. We will be using NLTK for accessing the stopwords list and scikit-learn for text preprocessing tasks.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
```

Step 2: Download the NLTK Stopwords
NLTK provides a list of commonly used stopwords in various languages. We need to download the stopwords for the English language using the following code:

```python
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

Step 3: Load and Explore the Dataset
Load your labeled dataset of customer support messages along with their sentiment labels. You can load the dataset using pandas or any other suitable library. Ensure that the dataset has a column containing the text messages and another column containing the corresponding sentiment labels.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('customer_support_dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(dataset.head())
```

Step 4: Perform Stopword Removal and Lowercasing
Now, we will perform the stopword removal and lowercasing on the text data. We will iterate over each customer support message and apply the preprocessing steps.

```python
# Initialize the stopwords list
stopwords_list = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Perform stopword removal and lowercasing
preprocessed_messages = []

for message in dataset['message']:
    # Convert the text to lowercase
    message = message.lower()
    
    # Tokenize the message into words
    words = message.split()
    
    # Remove stopwords from the message
    words = [word for word in words if word not in stopwords_list]
    
    # Join the words back into a single string
    preprocessed_message = ' '.join(words)
    
    # Add the preprocessed message to the list
    preprocessed_messages.append(preprocessed_message)
```

Step 5: Verify the Preprocessing Results
To ensure that the stopword removal and lowercasing were performed correctly, let's print a few preprocessed messages along with their original versions.

```python
# Print original and preprocessed messages

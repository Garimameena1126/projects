# Setting Up a New Project Directory

In this task, we will guide you through the process of setting up a new project directory for your web development project. This involves creating a new directory, initializing a Git repository, creating a basic HTML/CSS template for the frontend, and setting up a local development server. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create a New Project Directory

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the desired location where you want to create your project directory. For example, if you want to create it on your desktop, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop
   ```

3. Create a new directory for your project using the `mkdir` command. Choose a meaningful name for your project directory. For example:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-project
   ```

4. Change into the newly created directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-project
   ```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new project directory.

## Step 2: Initialize a New Git Repository

1. In the project directory, initialize a new Git repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Verify that the Git repository has been initialized by checking for the presence of a hidden `.git` directory:

   ```bash
   ls -a
   ```

   You should see the `.git` directory listed.

3. Optionally, you can set up a `.gitignore` file to exclude specific files or directories from being tracked by Git. Create a `.gitignore` file in the project directory and add the relevant entries. For example, to exclude the `node_modules` directory and the `.env` file, you can use the following content in your `.gitignore` file:

   ```
   node_modules/
   .env
   ```

Congratulations! You have initialized a new Git repository for your project.

## Step 3: Create a Basic HTML/CSS Template for the Frontend

1. Create a new file called `index.html` in your project directory using a text editor.

2. Add the basic structure of an HTML document to your `index.html` file:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     <title>My Project</title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>Welcome to My Project!</h1>
     <p>This is the homepage of my project.</p>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. Create a new file called `styles.css` in your project directory.

4. Add some basic styles to your `styles.css` file:

   ```css
   body {
     font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
     background-color: #f0f0f0;
     margin: 0;
     padding: 20px;
   }

   h1 {
     color: #333;
   }

   p {
     color: #666;
   }
   ```

Congratulations! You have created a basic HTML/CSS template for the frontend of your project.

## Step 4: Set Up a Local Development Server

1. Decide on the local development server you want to use. For example, you can use the `http-server` package in Node.js.

2. Install the `http-server` package globally by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

   Note: If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, make

 sure to install them first.

3. Once the installation is complete, start the local development server by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

4. The local development server should now be running. Open your web browser and access the provided URL, usually `http://localhost:8080`, to see your project's homepage.

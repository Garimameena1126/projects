# Installing Necessary Dependencies

In this guide, you will learn how to install the necessary dependencies, such as Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), for your project. These dependencies are essential for developing web applications. By following the step-by-step instructions below, you will be able to set up your development environment successfully.

## Step 1: Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It also provides access to a vast ecosystem of packages and libraries. Follow these steps to install Node.js:

1. Visit the official Node.js website at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. On the Node.js website, you will see two versions available for download: LTS (Long-Term Support) and Current. It is recommended to install the LTS version as it provides stability and long-term support for production projects.

3. Click on the LTS version download button to start the installation process.

4. Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the installation wizard.

5. During the installation, you will be prompted to choose various options. Leave the default options selected unless you have specific requirements.

6. Complete the installation by following the on-screen instructions.

7. To verify that Node.js has been successfully installed, open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command:

   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

   If Node.js is installed correctly, the command will display the installed version number.

## Step 2: Verify the Installation of npm

npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager that comes bundled with Node.js. It allows you to install and manage external packages and libraries for your Node.js projects. Follow these steps to verify the installation of npm:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

2. To check if npm is installed, type the following command:

   ```bash
   npm --version
   ```

   If npm is installed correctly, the command will display the installed version number.

## Step 3: Install Additional Dependencies

Depending on the requirements of your project, you may need to install additional dependencies. These dependencies can be specific packages or libraries that provide functionality beyond the core capabilities of Node.js and npm. Here's an example of how to install a popular package called Express, which is used for building web applications:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

2. Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command. For example, if your project directory is located on the desktop, you can use the command:

   ```bash
   cd Desktop/project-directory
   ```

3. Once inside your project directory, execute the following command to install Express:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

   This command tells npm to download and install the Express package.

4. Wait for npm to download and install the package. Once the process is complete, you will see a `node_modules` folder in your project directory. This folder contains the installed package and its dependencies.

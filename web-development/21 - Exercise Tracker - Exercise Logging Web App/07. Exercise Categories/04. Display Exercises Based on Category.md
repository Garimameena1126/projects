# Task: Modify the UI to Display Exercises Based on Their Category

In this task, we will focus on modifying the user interface to enhance the display of exercises based on their categories. By implementing this feature, users will be able to filter and view exercises specific to a particular category. Let's proceed with the step-by-step guide to modify the UI.

## Step 1: Update Exercise List Component

1. Open the file containing the Exercise List component in your frontend project.

2. Identify the part of the component responsible for rendering the list of exercises.

3. Add a state variable to hold the selected category.

   Example code snippet (React.js):
   ```jsx
   import React, { useState } from 'react';

   function ExerciseList() {
     const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState(null);

     // Rest of the component code...
   }
   ```

   Here, we initialize the `selectedCategory` state variable to `null`.

## Step 2: Add Category Filter

1. Locate the section of the user interface where the exercise categories are displayed.

2. Add an option to filter exercises based on categories. This can be done through a dropdown menu or a set of radio buttons.

   Example code snippet (React.js):
   ```jsx
   function ExerciseList() {
     // ...

     return (
       <div>
         <h2>Exercise List</h2>
         <div>
           <label htmlFor="category-filter">Filter by Category:</label>
           <select
             id="category-filter"
             value={selectedCategory || ''}
             onChange={(e) => setSelectedCategory(e.target.value || null)}
           >
             <option value="">All</option>
             <option value="category1">Category 1</option>
             <option value="category2">Category 2</option>
             {/* Add more options for each category */}
           </select>
         </div>
         {/* Render exercises based on selectedCategory */}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   In this code snippet, we assume that the exercise categories are represented by the values `"category1"`, `"category2"`, and so on. The `selectedCategory` state variable is bound to the dropdown menu's value, and the `onChange` event handler updates the selected category accordingly.

## Step 3: Filter Exercises Based on Category

1. Locate the part of the component where exercises are rendered.

2. Modify the rendering logic to consider the selected category and display only exercises that match the category.

   Example code snippet (React.js):
   ```jsx
   function ExerciseList() {
     // ...

     return (
       <div>
         <h2>Exercise List</h2>
         {/* ... */}
         {exercises.map((exercise) => {
           if (
             selectedCategory === null ||
             exercise.category === selectedCategory
           ) {
             return (
               <div key={exercise.id}>
                 <h3>{exercise.title}</h3>
                 <p>Category: {exercise.category}</p>
                 <p>{exercise.description}</p>
               </div>
             );
           }
           return null;
         })}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   In this code snippet, we use a conditional check to determine if an exercise should be rendered. If no category is selected (`selectedCategory` is `null`) or the exercise's category matches the selected category, the exercise is rendered. Otherwise, it is skipped.

## Step 4: Test and Refine

1. Start your frontend server and ensure it is running properly.

2. Verify that the exercise list is displayed with the category filter.

3. Select different categories from the filter and observe the exercise list updating accordingly.

4. If any issues

 arise, inspect the console for error messages and review your code to identify potential mistakes.

5. Make any necessary refinements or adjustments based on testing and feedback.

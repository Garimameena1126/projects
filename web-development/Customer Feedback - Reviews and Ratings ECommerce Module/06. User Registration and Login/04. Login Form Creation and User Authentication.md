# Creating a Login Form and Authenticating Users

In this guide, we will learn how to create a login form and authenticate users against stored credentials in our user registration and login functionality project. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Create the Login Form
To begin, we need to create a login form in our web application. The login form typically consists of input fields for the username/email and password, along with a submit button. Here's an example of how to create a basic login form using HTML:

```html
<form action="/login" method="POST">
  <label for="username">Username/Email:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>

  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>

  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

In this example, the form's action attribute is set to "/login", which is the URL where we will handle the login form submission. Make sure to replace "/login" with the appropriate URL path for your application.

## Step 2: Handle the Login Form Submission
Next, we need to handle the login form submission on the server-side. We will receive the submitted form data (i.e., username/email and password) and validate it against the stored credentials in the database. Here's an example of how to handle the login form submission using Node.js and Express:

1. Install the necessary packages by running the following command in your project directory:
    ```shell
    npm install express body-parser
    ```

2. Create a new file, e.g., "login.js", and add the following code to handle the login form submission:
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
    
    const app = express();
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    
    app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
      const { username, password } = req.body;
    
      // Retrieve the user's hashed password from the database based on the username/email
      // Assuming you have a database connection established (refer to the previous task)
    
      connection.query('SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = ? OR email = ?', [username, username], (error, results) => {
        if (error) {
          console.error('Error retrieving user data:', error);
          // Handle the error appropriately
        } else {
          if (results.length === 0) {
            // User not found
            res.send('Invalid username/email');
          } else {
            const hashedPassword = results[0].password;
    
            bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword, (compareError, isMatch) => {
              if (compareError) {
                console.error('Error comparing passwords:', compareError);
                // Handle the error appropriately
              } else if (isMatch) {
                // Passwords match, login successful
                res.send('Login successful');
              } else {
                // Passwords don't match
                res.send('Invalid password');
              }
            });
          }
        }
      });
    });
    
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server started on port 3000');
    });
    ```

In this example, we use the `bcrypt.compare()` function to compare the submitted password with the hashed password retrieved from the database. If the passwords match, we consider the login successful.

Make sure to replace `'SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = ? OR email = ?'` with the appropriate SQL query to retrieve the user's hashed password from the database based on the username/email.

## Step 3: Test the Login Functionality


Now that we have created the login form and implemented the server-side logic for authentication, let's test the login functionality. Start your server by running the following command in your project directory:

```shell
node login.js
```

Open your web application in a browser and navigate to the login page. Enter a valid username/email and password combination, then click the login button. If the credentials are correct, you should see a message indicating a successful login. Otherwise, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

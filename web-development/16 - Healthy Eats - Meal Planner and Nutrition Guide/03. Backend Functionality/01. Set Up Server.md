

### 1. Install Node.js and npm
Before setting up the server, ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

### 2. Create a New Project Directory
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
mkdir meal-planner
cd meal-planner
```

### 3. Initialize a New Node.js Project
Initialize a new Node.js project using npm. Run the following command and follow the prompts to create a `package.json` file:

```bash
npm init
```

### 4. Install Express.js
Install Express.js as a dependency for your project by running the following command:

```bash
npm install express
```

### 5. Create the Server File
Create a new file named `server.js` in your project directory. This file will contain the code for setting up the server.

### 6. Import the Required Dependencies
Inside `server.js`, import the required dependencies, including Express.js, by adding the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
```

### 7. Create an Express App
Create an instance of the Express application by adding the following code:

```javascript
const app = express();
```

### 8. Define Routes
Define routes to handle incoming requests. For this guide, we'll create a simple route that returns a "Hello, world!" message.

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});
```

This route listens for GET requests to the root URL (`/`) and sends the response with the "Hello, world!" message.

### 9. Start the Server
Start the server and make it listen for incoming requests by adding the following code:

```javascript
const port = 3000; // Choose a port number of your choice

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

### 10. Test the Server
Save the changes to `server.js` and run the server using the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see the message "Server is listening on port 3000" in the console, indicating that the server is running.

### 11. Access the Server
Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the "Hello, world!" message displayed in the browser.

# Creating a JSON File to Store Product Data with Sample Entries

In this guide, we will create a JSON file to store the product data for our inventory management system. The JSON file will contain sample entries representing different products. This data will be used to populate the product listing page and demonstrate the functionality of the system.

## Step 1: Create the JSON File

1. Open a text editor of your choice.
2. Create a new file and save it as `products.json`. Make sure to use the `.json` file extension.
3. In the `products.json` file, define an empty array to store the product entries:
```json
[]
```

## Step 2: Add Sample Product Entries

1. Inside the array brackets (`[]`), add multiple objects representing the product entries. Each object should contain properties such as `id`, `name`, `category`, `price`, and any other relevant details for your inventory management system. Here's an example of two sample product entries:
```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Product A",
        "category": "Category 1",
        "price": 10.99,
        "description": "This is product A. It is a great product for your needs."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Product B",
        "category": "Category 2",
        "price": 19.99,
        "description": "Product B is a high-quality item that will meet your expectations."
    }
]
```
Feel free to add more sample product entries as needed. Ensure that each product entry is enclosed in curly braces `{}` and separated by a comma `,`.

## Step 3: Save the JSON File

1. Save the `products.json` file.
2. Place the file in a location accessible to your backend server. Typically, you would store it in a dedicated folder, such as `/data` or `/resources`, within your project directory.

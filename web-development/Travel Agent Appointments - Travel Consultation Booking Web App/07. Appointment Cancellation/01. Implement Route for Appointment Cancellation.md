
# Implement a route to handle cancellation requests based on the appointment ID
1. **Create a route**: In your server-side code (e.g., using Node.js and Express), create a new route that will handle cancellation requests. This route should be associated with an appropriate URL endpoint. For example:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Define the cancellation route
   app.delete('/appointments/:id', (req, res) => {
     // Handle cancellation logic
   });

   // Start the server
   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

   In this example, the route is defined using `app.delete` because we want to handle DELETE requests for canceling appointments. The `:id` parameter in the route URL indicates that we can access the appointment ID passed as part of the URL.

2. **Access the appointment ID**: Inside the route handler function, access the appointment ID from the URL parameter (`req.params.id`).

   ```javascript
   app.delete('/appointments/:id', (req, res) => {
     const appointmentId = req.params.id;
     // Handle cancellation logic
   });
   ```

3. **Handle cancellation logic**: Implement the necessary logic to handle the cancellation of the appointment based on the provided ID. This may involve accessing the database and removing the corresponding appointment entry.

   ```javascript
   app.delete('/appointments/:id', (req, res) => {
     const appointmentId = req.params.id;

     // Code to remove the appointment from the database
     // Replace the following code with your actual database integration
     const db = require('mongodb');
     db.collection('appointments')
       .deleteOne({ _id: appointmentId })
       .then(() => {
         res.status(200).json({ message: 'Appointment canceled successfully' });
       })
       .catch((error) => {
         res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to cancel appointment' });
       });
   });
   ```

   In this example, we assume that you are using MongoDB as the database. Adjust the code accordingly if you are using a different database.

4. **Test the route**: Start your server and send a DELETE request to the cancellation route with the appropriate appointment ID. You can use tools like cURL or Postman to simulate the request.

   ```
   DELETE /appointments/12345
   ```

   Replace `12345` with the actual appointment ID you want to cancel.

5. **Verify cancellation**: After sending the cancellation request, verify that the corresponding appointment is successfully removed from the database. You can check the database directly or implement additional logic to confirm the cancellation status.

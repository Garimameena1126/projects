# Securing Backend APIs by Verifying Authentication Tokens

In this task, we will secure the backend APIs of our inventory management system by verifying authentication tokens for protected routes. This ensures that only authenticated users with valid tokens can access certain endpoints or perform specific actions.

## Step 1: Set Up Authentication Middleware

1. Identify the routes or endpoints that should be protected and require authentication. These are typically routes that involve sensitive operations or access to user-specific data.

2. Create an authentication middleware function that will be executed before processing each protected route.

3. In the authentication middleware function, retrieve the authentication token from the request headers or cookies.

    Example (using Express.js):
    ```javascript
    // Assuming you have configured JWT authentication and have a secret key
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
    
    function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
      const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
      const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
    
      if (token == null) {
        return res.sendStatus(401); // Unauthorized
      }
    
      jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, user) => {
        if (err) {
          return res.sendStatus(403); // Forbidden
        }
        req.user = user;
        next();
      });
    }
    ```

## Step 2: Apply Authentication Middleware to Protected Routes

1. Identify the routes that need to be protected and apply the authentication middleware function to them.

    Example (using Express.js):
    ```javascript
    // Assuming you have defined routes for your inventory management system
    app.get('/api/sensitive-data', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
      // Only authenticated users with valid tokens can access this route
      // Retrieve sensitive data and send the response
    });
    
    app.post('/api/protected-action', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
      // Only authenticated users with valid tokens can perform this action
      // Process the action and send the response
    });
    ```

## Step 3: Obtain and Include Authentication Token in Requests

1. When making requests to protected routes, include the authentication token in the request headers or cookies.

    Example (using Axios for making HTTP requests):
    ```javascript
    const axios = require('axios');
    
    const token = '...'; // Obtain the token from the login process or storage
    
    axios.get('/api/sensitive-data', {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
      }
    })
    .then(response => {
      // Handle the response
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // Handle errors
    });
    ```

## Step 4: Test and Verify API Security

1. Test the protected routes by making requests without an authentication token. Verify that the server responds with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden).

2. Test the protected routes by making requests with an invalid or expired authentication token. Verify that the server responds with a status code of 403 (Forbidden).

3. Test the protected routes by making requests with a valid authentication token. Verify that the server processes the requests and responds accordingly.

4. Review the server logs and any error messages to identify and fix any issues related to authentication and authorization.

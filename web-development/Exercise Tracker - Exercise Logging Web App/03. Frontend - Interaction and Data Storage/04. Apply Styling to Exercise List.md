#  Add Basic Styling and Formatting to the Exercise List

In this task, we will improve the visual appearance of the exercise list displayed on the user interface (UI). By adding basic styling and formatting, we can make the exercise list more readable and visually appealing. Follow the step-by-step guide below to implement this feature.

## Prerequisites

- HTML knowledge
- CSS basics
- Code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed

## Steps

1. **Open Code Editor**

   Launch your preferred code editor or IDE.

2. **Open the CSS File**

   Open the CSS file associated with your HTML file containing the exercise list.

3. **Style the Exercise List**

   Add CSS styles to enhance the appearance of the exercise list. Below is an example of basic styling that you can use as a starting point. Feel free to customize the styles according to your project's design requirements.

   ```css
   #exercise-list {
     list-style-type: none;
     padding: 0;
   }

   #exercise-list li {
     margin-bottom: 10px;
     padding: 10px;
     background-color: #f2f2f2;
     border-radius: 4px;
   }

   #exercise-list li:hover {
     background-color: #e6e6e6;
   }
   ```

   In this example, we target the `exercise-list` ID and remove the default bullet points by setting `list-style-type` to "none." We also remove the default padding with `padding: 0`.

   Additionally, we target the `li` elements within the `exercise-list` and add the following styles:

   - `margin-bottom: 10px`: Adds a 10-pixel margin below each exercise item to create spacing between them.
   - `padding: 10px`: Adds 10 pixels of padding within each exercise item to create some breathing space.
   - `background-color: #f2f2f2`: Sets a light gray background color for each exercise item to distinguish it from the surrounding elements.
   - `border-radius: 4px`: Applies a slight border radius of 4 pixels to soften the edges of the exercise items.

   Additionally, we use the `:hover` pseudo-class selector to change the background color of the exercise item when the user hovers over it. In this example, we set the background color to a slightly lighter shade of gray (`#e6e6e6`) to provide visual feedback to the user.

4. **Save the CSS File**

   Save the changes made to the CSS file.

5. **Test the Application**

   Open the corresponding HTML file in a web browser and verify that the exercise list now has the desired styling and formatting. Each exercise item should be visually separated from others, and hovering over an item should highlight it.

   If the styling doesn't appear as expected, double-check that the CSS file is properly linked to the HTML file and that there are no syntax errors in the CSS code.

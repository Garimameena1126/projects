# Hyperparameter Tuning

In this task, we will explore different hyperparameter settings for the chosen classification model to improve its performance. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training a machine learning model and cannot be learned from the data. By tuning these hyperparameters, we can optimize the performance of the model. We will use techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Choose a Classification Model

Before we can tune the hyperparameters, we need to choose a classification model to work with. In this guide, let's assume we have selected the Random Forest algorithm as our classification model. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

## Step 2: Define the Hyperparameter Space

The next step is to define the hyperparameter space, which is a set of possible values for each hyperparameter that we want to tune. For the Random Forest algorithm, some common hyperparameters include the number of trees (`n_estimators`), the maximum depth of each tree (`max_depth`), and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (`min_samples_split`).

Let's define a range of values for each hyperparameter:

- `n_estimators`: [100, 200, 300]
- `max_depth`: [None, 5, 10]
- `min_samples_split`: [2, 5, 10]

You can choose different ranges depending on your specific problem and dataset. Feel free to experiment with different values.

## Step 3: Set up Cross-Validation

To evaluate the performance of different hyperparameter settings, we will use cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique that helps estimate how well a model will generalize to new data. It involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets (folds), training the model on a subset, and evaluating it on the remaining fold.

We can use the `cross_val_score` function from scikit-learn library to perform cross-validation. This function takes care of splitting the data and evaluating the model for each fold.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Assuming you have already preprocessed your data and split it into features (X) and target (y)
# Assuming you have already instantiated your Random Forest model as 'model'

# Perform cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)  # 5-fold cross-validation
```

In the above code snippet, we perform 5-fold cross-validation by setting `cv=5`. Adjust the number of folds as per your preference.

## Step 4: Perform Grid Search

Grid search is a technique that exhaustively searches the hyperparameter space defined in Step 2 to find the best combination of hyperparameters. It evaluates the model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters and returns the combination that yields the best performance.

We can use the `GridSearchCV` class from scikit-learn to perform grid search. It takes the model, hyperparameter space, and cross-validation configuration as inputs.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Assuming you have already instantiated your Random Forest model as 'model'

# Define the hyperparameter space
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

# Perform grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X, y)
```

In the above code snippet, we define the hyperparameter space as `param_grid` and perform grid search with 5-fold cross-validation. The `fit

` method of `GridSearchCV` executes the grid search process.

## Step 5: Analyze the Results

After performing grid search, we can analyze the results to determine the best combination of hyperparameters and the corresponding model performance.

```python
# Get the best hyperparameters and the corresponding score
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
best_score = grid_search.best_score_

print("Best Hyperparameters:", best_params)
print("Best Score:", best_score)
```

The `best_params_` attribute of `GridSearchCV` gives us the best combination of hyperparameters, and the `best_score_` attribute gives us the corresponding best score.

## Step 6: Evaluate the Best Model

Finally, we can evaluate the performance of the best model on unseen data. Remember to split your data into training and testing sets before performing hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Assuming you have already preprocessed your data and split it into features (X) and target (y)
# Assuming you have already instantiated your Random Forest model as 'model'

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instantiate the best model with the best hyperparameters
best_model = RandomForestClassifier(**best_params)

# Train the best model on the training data
best_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

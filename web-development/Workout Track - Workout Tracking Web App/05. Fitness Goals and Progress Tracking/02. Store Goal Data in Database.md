# Module 5: Implement Fitness Goals and Progress Tracking

## Task: Store Goal Data in the Database, Associating it with the Logged-in User

In this task, we will focus on storing fitness goal data in the database and associating it with the logged-in user. This will allow us to track and manage individual users' goals effectively. Follow the step-by-step guide below to accomplish this task.

### Step 1: Set Up the Database

Before we can store goal data in the database, we need to ensure that our database is properly set up. Follow these steps to set up the database:

1. Determine the type of database you want to use. Popular choices include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. For this guide, we will use MySQL as an example.

2. Install the chosen database system by following the installation instructions provided by the respective database's documentation.

3. Once the database system is installed, open the database management tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench) to create a new database. Give it an appropriate name, such as "fitness_tracker".

4. Create a new table named "goals" within the "fitness_tracker" database. This table will store the goal data. Define the necessary columns, such as "id", "user_id", "goal_type", "target_value", and "created_at". Set the appropriate data types for each column.

5. Save the changes, and make note of the database connection details (host, port, username, password) as we will need them in the next steps.

### Step 2: Configure the Database Connection

To interact with the database from our web application, we need to configure the database connection. Follow these steps to configure the database connection:

1. Open your project in your preferred code editor or IDE.

2. Locate the file responsible for managing the database connection. In many web frameworks, this file is often named `database.js`, `db.js`, or similar.

3. Inside the file, find the section where the database connection parameters are defined. Replace the placeholder values with your actual database connection details (host, port, username, password).

4. Save the changes to the file.

### Step 3: Update the User Model

To associate the logged-in user with their fitness goals, we need to update the user model to establish the relationship between users and goals. Follow these steps to update the user model:

1. Locate the file that defines the user model in your project. This file is typically named `user.js`, `UserModel.js`, or similar.

2. Inside the user model file, add a new relationship definition to establish a one-to-many relationship between users and goals. Depending on your chosen database ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) or query builder, the syntax may vary slightly. Here's an example using Sequelize (a popular Node.js ORM):

   ```javascript
   // user.js
   
   const { DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
   const sequelize = require('../database'); // Import the configured database connection
   
   const User = sequelize.define('User', {
     // Existing user model properties
   
     // Add the association to the goals table
     // This assumes the foreign key in the goals table is named "user_id"
     // Adjust the foreignKey and sourceKey values as needed
     goals: {
       type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
       references: {
         model: 'goals',
         key: 'user_id',
       },
     },
   });
   
   module.exports = User;
   ```

   Note: The exact syntax may differ depending on the ORM or query builder you are using. Consult the documentation for your chosen tool for more information on defining associations.

3. Save the changes to the user model file.

### Step 4: Handle Goal Data Storage

Now

 that we have set up the database and updated the user model, we can proceed with handling goal data storage. Follow these steps to store goal data associated with the logged-in user:

1. Identify the appropriate route or controller method that handles the submission of fitness goals. For example, this could be a route like `/goals` or a controller method named `createGoal()`.

2. Inside the route or controller method, retrieve the goal data submitted by the user. This can be done by accessing the form data or request body, depending on your web framework.

3. Obtain the user ID of the logged-in user. This information is typically available through the authentication system you are using. Retrieve the user ID from the authenticated user's session or token.

4. Create a new goal object using the retrieved data and the user ID. Depending on your chosen ORM or query builder, the code may vary. Here's an example using Sequelize:

   ```javascript
   // Assuming you have a Goal model defined
   
   const Goal = require('../models/goal');
   
   // ...
   
   // Inside the route or controller method
   const { goalType, targetValue } = req.body; // Retrieve goal data from request body
   
   // Get the logged-in user's ID from the authenticated session or token
   const userId = req.user.id;
   
   // Create a new goal record associated with the user
   Goal.create({
     user_id: userId,
     goal_type: goalType,
     target_value: targetValue,
     created_at: new Date(),
   })
     .then((goal) => {
       // Handle successful goal creation
       res.status(201).json({ message: 'Goal created successfully!', goal });
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // Handle goal creation error
       console.error('Failed to create goal:', error);
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to create goal' });
     });
   ```

   Adjust the code according to your specific database ORM or query builder.

5. Save the changes to the route or controller file.

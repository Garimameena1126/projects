1. Open the JavaScript file associated with your project.

2. Locate the section where you handle the wishlist functionality.

3. Define a function to save the wishlist data to local storage. Here's an example code snippet:

   ```javascript
   function saveWishlistToLocalStorage(wishlist) {
     localStorage.setItem('wishlist', JSON.stringify(wishlist));
   }
   ```

   In the code above, we use the `localStorage.setItem()` method to save the wishlist data as a string in the local storage. We convert the `wishlist` object to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()`.

4. Modify your existing code to call the `saveWishlistToLocalStorage()` function whenever the wishlist is updated. For example, if you have a function called `addToWishlist()` to add products to the wishlist, update it as follows:

   ```javascript
   function addToWishlist(product) {
     // Add the product to the wishlist array
     wishlist.push(product);
     
     // Save the updated wishlist to local storage
     saveWishlistToLocalStorage(wishlist);
     
     // Other logic to update the UI or perform additional tasks
   }
   ```

   By calling `saveWishlistToLocalStorage(wishlist)` after modifying the wishlist, you ensure that the updated data is stored in local storage.

5. Define a function to load the wishlist data from local storage. Here's an example code snippet:

   ```javascript
   function loadWishlistFromLocalStorage() {
     const savedWishlist = localStorage.getItem('wishlist');
     return savedWishlist ? JSON.parse(savedWishlist) : [];
   }
   ```

   In the code above, we use the `localStorage.getItem()` method to retrieve the wishlist data as a string from local storage. We check if the data exists (`savedWishlist`) and parse it back into an object using `JSON.parse()`. If the data is not found, we return an empty array.

6. Initialize the wishlist array by loading the data from local storage when the page loads. Here's an example code snippet:

   ```javascript
   let wishlist = loadWishlistFromLocalStorage();
   ```

   By assigning the result of `loadWishlistFromLocalStorage()` to the `wishlist` variable, you ensure that the wishlist data is loaded from local storage when the page is accessed.

7. Test your application by adding products to the wishlist and refreshing the page. The wishlist data should persist, and the wishlist functionality should work correctly even after page refreshes or browser restarts.

8. Make further adjustments to the code and functionality as needed, based on your project's requirements.

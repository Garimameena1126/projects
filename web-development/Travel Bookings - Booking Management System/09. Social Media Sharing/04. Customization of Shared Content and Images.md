# Customize Shared Content and Images to Provide an Attractive Preview

In this guide, we will focus on customizing the shared content and images to provide an attractive preview when users share travel packages on social media platforms. By customizing the shared content and images, we can enhance the visual appeal and engagement of the shared posts. We will use meta tags and Open Graph protocol to customize the preview information.

## Step 1: Add Meta Tags to the HTML Head

To customize the shared content and images, we need to add appropriate meta tags to the `<head>` section of our HTML document. These meta tags will provide information about the title, description, and image URL to social media platforms when our pages are shared.

Add the following code inside the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Amazing Beach Getaway">
<meta property="og:description" content="Escape to a tropical paradise with our amazing beach getaway package. Enjoy pristine beaches, luxurious accommodations, and a range of exciting activities.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/images/beach_getaway.jpg">
<meta property="og:image:alt" content="Beach Getaway Preview">
```

Ensure that you replace the values for `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, and `og:image:alt` with the actual information for your travel package.

## Step 2: Customize Content and Images for Sharing

To provide an attractive preview, we can customize the shared content and images specifically for social media sharing. This customization allows us to present a visually appealing and informative preview when users share our travel packages.

### Customize Content

To customize the shared content, we need to ensure that the `og:title` and `og:description` meta tags contain relevant and engaging information about the package. Use descriptive language, highlight unique features, and provide a compelling description to entice users to engage with the shared post.

### Customize Images

To customize the shared image, we need to set the `og:image` meta tag to the URL of the desired image. It's essential to choose an eye-catching image that represents the package effectively. The recommended image size for social media sharing is typically 1200x630 pixels, but you may need to refer to specific guidelines for each platform.

## Step 3: Test the Preview

Once you have added the meta tags and customized the content and images, it's important to test the preview to ensure it appears as intended. You can use the social media platform's debugging tools or online Open Graph preview tools to view how the shared post will look.

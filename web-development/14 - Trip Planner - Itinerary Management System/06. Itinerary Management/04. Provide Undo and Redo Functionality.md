## Providing Undo/Redo Functionality for Itinerary Modifications

In this guide, we will implement the functionality to allow users to undo and redo modifications made to itineraries. This feature will provide users with the ability to revert changes and restore previous states of their itineraries.

### Step 1: Track Itinerary Modifications

1. Identify the types of modifications that can be made to an itinerary (e.g., adding, editing, or deleting activities).
2. Implement a mechanism to track these modifications and store them in memory.

For example, you can use an array to store the modifications made to an itinerary:

```javascript
let itineraryModifications = [];
```

### Step 2: Implement Undo Functionality

1. Add an "Undo" button or link to your user interface.
2. Assign an event listener to the "Undo" button to capture user interactions.
3. Retrieve the most recent modification from the `itineraryModifications` array.
4. Reverse the modification (e.g., if an activity was added, remove it; if an activity was deleted, restore it).
5. Update the user interface to reflect the changes.
6. Remove the undone modification from the `itineraryModifications` array.

Example:

```javascript
const undoButton = document.querySelector('#undo-button');

undoButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const lastModification = itineraryModifications.pop();

  if (lastModification) {
    if (lastModification.type === 'add') {
      // Reverse addition: Remove the activity
      const activity = lastModification.activity;
      // Code to remove activity from itinerary and update UI
    } else if (lastModification.type === 'delete') {
      // Reverse deletion: Restore the deleted activity
      const activity = lastModification.activity;
      // Code to restore activity to itinerary and update UI
    }

    // Update the user interface to reflect the changes
    // Code to update UI after undoing modification
  }
});
```

In the above example, we add an event listener to the "Undo" button and retrieve the last modification from the `itineraryModifications` array. Depending on the type of modification, we reverse the change by either removing the added activity or restoring the deleted activity. Finally, we update the user interface to reflect the changes.

### Step 3: Implement Redo Functionality

1. Add a "Redo" button or link to your user interface.
2. Assign an event listener to the "Redo" button to capture user interactions.
3. Retrieve the undone modification from a separate array (e.g., `undoneModifications`).
4. Apply the undone modification to the itinerary.
5. Update the user interface to reflect the changes.
6. Remove the redone modification from the `undoneModifications` array and add it back to the `itineraryModifications` array.

Example:

```javascript
const redoButton = document.querySelector('#redo-button');

redoButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const redoneModification = undoneModifications.pop();

  if (redoneModification) {
    if (redoneModification.type === 'add') {
      // Apply the addition: Add the activity
      const activity = redoneModification.activity;
      // Code to add activity to itinerary and update UI
    } else if (redoneModification.type === 'delete') {
      // Apply the deletion: Remove the activity
      const activity = redoneModification.activity;
      // Code to remove activity from itinerary and update UI
    }

    // Update the user interface to reflect the changes
    // Code to update UI after redoing modification

    // Move the modification from undoneModifications to itineraryModifications
    itineraryModifications.push(redoneModification);
  }
});
```

In the above example, we add an event listener to the "Redo" button and retrieve the last undone modification from the `undoneModifications` array. Based on the type of modification, we apply the undone change to the itinerary by either adding the activity or removing it. Then, we update the user interface accordingly. Finally, we move the redone modification from the `undoneModifications` array back to the `itineraryModifications` array.

### Step 4: Test the Functionality

1. Save your JavaScript file.
2. Interact with the user interface by making modifications to itineraries (e.g., adding, editing, or deleting activities).
3. Verify that the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons work as expected, allowing you to revert and restore modifications.

### Step 5: Enhancements (Optional)

1. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of modifications stored, preventing excessive memory usage.
2. Add keyboard shortcuts for undo and redo actions to improve accessibility and user experience.
3. Customize the appearance of the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons to match your user interface design.

In this guide, we will walk through the process of setting up a new project using Node.js as the web development framework. We will also install any necessary dependencies and create a basic user interface for the ecommerce website, including a homepage, product listing page, and product detail page.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org).
- Text Editor: Choose a text editor of your preference. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text.

### Step 1: Create a New Project Directory

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. For example:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/projects
   ```
3. Create a new directory for your project. Replace `project-name` with your preferred name:
   ```bash
   mkdir project-name
   ```
4. Move into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

### Step 2: Initialize a Node.js Project

1. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command in your project directory:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
   This will create a new `package.json` file with default settings.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

1. Install the necessary dependencies for your project. In this guide, we will use Express.js as the web framework and other libraries to help with development. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

### Step 4: Create a Basic Server

1. Create a new file called `server.js` in your project directory.
2. Open `server.js` in your text editor.
3. Import the Express.js module and create a new Express application:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   ```
4. Set up a basic route to handle the homepage:
   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Welcome to the homepage');
   });
   ```
5. Start the server and listen on a specified port (e.g., 3000):
   ```javascript
   const port = 3000;
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```

### Step 5: Create Basic User Interface

1. Create a new directory called `public` in your project directory. This directory will hold static files such as HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript.
   ```bash
   mkdir public
   ```
2. Inside the `public` directory, create an `index.html` file for the homepage:
   ```bash
   touch public/index.html
   ```
3. Open `public/index.html` in your text editor and add the following content:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
     <title>My Ecommerce Website</title>
     <!-- Add any necessary CSS or external stylesheets -->
   </head>
   <body>
     <h1>Welcome to My Ecommerce Website</h1>
     <!-- Add any necessary HTML content -->
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
4. Similarly, create `product-list.html` and `product-detail.html` files in the `public` directory and add the necessary HTML content for the product listing and product detail pages.

### Step 6: Run the Project

1. In your terminal, make sure you are in the project directory.
2. Start the server by running the following command:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the homepage of your ecommerce website.
4. Test the other pages by accessing `http://localhost:3000/product-list` and `http://localhost:3000/product-detail`. Verify that the respective pages are displayed correctly.

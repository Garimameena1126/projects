# Implementing User Registration and Login Functionality

In this guide, we will implement user registration and login functionality for our travel agency website. This will allow users to create an account, log in with their credentials, and access personalized features. Let's proceed with the following steps:

## Step 1: Create the Database Table

1. Ensure that you have set up a database for your project.

2. Create a table named `users` in the database to store user information. The table should have the following columns:

   - `id` (auto-increment primary key)
   - `username` (varchar)
   - `email` (varchar)
   - `password` (varchar)

   You can use SQL statements to create the table. Here's an example using MySQL:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     username VARCHAR(255),
     email VARCHAR(255),
     password VARCHAR(255)
   );
   ```

   Note: It is important to hash the passwords before storing them in the database for security. We will address this later in the guide.

## Step 2: Create the Registration Form

1. In your HTML file, create a form element to capture user registration details. The form should include the following input fields:

   - Username (text input)
   - Email (email input)
   - Password (password input)
   - Confirm Password (password input)

   Here's an example:

   ```html
   <form action="/register" method="POST">
     <label for="username">Username:</label>
     <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
     <br>

     <label for="email">Email:</label>
     <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
     <br>

     <label for="password">Password:</label>
     <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
     <br>

     <label for="confirmPassword">Confirm Password:</label>
     <input type="password" id="confirmPassword" name="confirmPassword" required>
     <br>

     <button type="submit">Register</button>
   </form>
   ```

   Note: Make sure to replace `/register` in the `action` attribute with the appropriate endpoint in your backend.

2. Add server-side validation to ensure the data entered by the user meets your requirements (e.g., username should be unique, email should be valid, password should meet complexity criteria, etc.). Use the backend programming language of your choice to perform these validations.

3. If there are validation errors, display appropriate error messages to the user and highlight the invalid fields. Here's an example of displaying an error message for the username field:

   ```html
   <label for="username">Username:</label>
   <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
   {% if errors.username %}
   <span class="error">{{ errors.username }}</span>
   {% endif %}
   ```

   Customize the error messages and styling based on your design preferences.

4. Once the form is submitted and all validations pass, handle the registration request on the server. Insert the user's information into the `users` table in the database. Remember to hash the password using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before storing it. Use appropriate database libraries or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools for your backend to interact with the database.

## Step 3: Implement User Login Functionality

1. Create a login form in your HTML file to capture user login credentials. The form should include the following input fields:

   - Email (email input)
   - Password (password input)

   Here's an example:

   ```html
   <form action="/login" method="POST">
     <label for="email">Email:</label>
     <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
     <br>

     <label for="password">Password:</label>
     <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
     <br>

     <button type="submit">Login</button>
   </form>
   ```

   Note: Replace `/login` in the `action` attribute with the appropriate endpoint in your backend.

2. Handle the login request on the server. Retrieve the user's information from the `users` table based on the provided email. Verify the password by comparing the hashed stored password with the entered password. Use appropriate authentication libraries or functions provided by your backend framework or programming language.

3. If the login is successful, you can implement session-based or token-based authentication to maintain the user's logged-in state across requests. Use libraries or middleware provided by your backend framework to handle sessions or generate tokens.

   - Session-based authentication: Set a session cookie on the client-side to identify the user's session. This allows the server to validate the user's session and authenticate subsequent requests. Refer to your backend framework's documentation for session management.

   - Token-based authentication: Generate a token (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Token) upon successful login and return it to the client. The client includes this token in the request headers for subsequent authenticated requests. Verify the token on the server to authenticate the user. Refer to libraries or middleware specific to token-based authentication in your backend.

4. Handle failed login attempts by displaying appropriate error messages to the user, such as "Invalid email or password." Allow the user to retry or provide options for password recovery.

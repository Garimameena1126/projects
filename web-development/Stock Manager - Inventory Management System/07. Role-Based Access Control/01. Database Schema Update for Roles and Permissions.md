# Updating Database Schema to Include Roles and Permissions

In this guide, we will focus on updating the database schema to include roles and permissions. By adding these entities to the schema, we can establish a foundation for implementing role-based access control (RBAC) in our application. Let's proceed with the step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Identify Database System and Connect to Database

Before updating the database schema, ensure that you have identified the database system you are using for your application (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB). Additionally, establish a connection to the database using the appropriate client or driver provided by your chosen database system.

For example, if you are using MySQL and Node.js, you can connect to the database using the `mysql2` package. Here's an example of establishing a connection:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql2');

// Create connection
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'username',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'your_database',
});

// Connect to the database
connection.connect((err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Failed to connect to the database:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('Connected to the database!');
});
```

Make sure to replace `'localhost'`, `'username'`, `'password'`, and `'your_database'` with the appropriate values for your database configuration.

## Step 2: Update Database Schema with Roles and Permissions Tables

To update the database schema, we need to add two new tables: `roles` and `permissions`. These tables will store information about the roles and permissions available in our application.

### Creating the Roles Table

The `roles` table will store information about different roles that can be assigned to users. Each role will have a unique identifier and a name.

Here's an example of creating the `roles` table using SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE roles (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

### Creating the Permissions Table

The `permissions` table will store information about different permissions that can be associated with roles. Each permission will have a unique identifier and a name.

Here's an example of creating the `permissions` table using SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE permissions (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

### Creating the Role-Permission Mapping Table

In addition to the `roles` and `permissions` tables, we need a mapping table to establish a relationship between roles and permissions. This table will store the associations between roles and the permissions they have.

Here's an example of creating the `role_permissions` table using SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE role_permissions (
  role_id INT,
  permission_id INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (role_id, permission_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (permission_id) REFERENCES permissions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

In this example, we create a mapping table called `role_permissions`. It has two foreign keys referencing the `id` columns of the `roles` and `permissions` tables, respectively. The primary key is defined as a combination of the `role_id` and `permission_id` columns.

## Step 3: Modify Existing Tables to Support Role Associations (if needed)

If you have existing tables in your database that need to associate records with roles, you may need to modify them to include a foreign key referencing the `roles` table. This step is optional and depends on your specific application requirements.

For example, if you have a `users` table and you want to associate each user with a role, you can add a
foreign key column named `role_id` to the `users` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN role_id INT,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES roles(id);
```

Make sure to adjust the table and column names according to your existing schema.

## Step 4: Update Application Code to Reflect Schema Changes

After updating the database schema, you need to reflect these changes in your application code. This includes modifying the models, database queries, and any other relevant components that interact with the database.

For example, if you are using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like Sequelize, you would define the `Role` and `Permission` models and their associations. Here's an example:

```javascript
// models/Role.js
const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = require('../database'); // Assuming you have a Sequelize instance named 'sequelize'

class Role extends Model {}
Role.init(
  {
    name: DataTypes.STRING,
  },
  {
    sequelize,
    modelName: 'Role',
  }
);

// models/Permission.js
const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = require('../database');

class Permission extends Model {}
Permission.init(
  {
    name: DataTypes.STRING,
  },
  {
    sequelize,
    modelName: 'Permission',
  }
);

// Define associations
Role.belongsToMany(Permission, { through: 'RolePermission' });
Permission.belongsToMany(Role, { through: 'RolePermission' });

// Export models
module.exports = { Role, Permission };
```

In this example, we define the `Role` and `Permission` models using Sequelize. We also establish a many-to-many association between them using a junction table called `'RolePermission'`.

Remember to adjust the code based on the ORM or database library you are using and the specific requirements of your application.

## Step 5: Apply Database Schema Changes

Now that we have updated the database schema and modified our application code, it's time to apply these changes to the database.

Depending on your setup, you can use migration tools or manually execute the SQL statements to apply the schema changes. If you are using an ORM like Sequelize, you can use migrations to handle these changes in a structured manner.

For example, if you are using Sequelize, you can create a migration file to apply the schema changes:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name add-roles-and-permissions
```

This command will generate a migration file in which you can write the necessary SQL statements to create the `roles`, `permissions`, and `role_permissions` tables. Once you have written the migration file, you can apply the changes by running the migration:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

Make sure to adjust the commands based on the ORM or migration tool you are using.

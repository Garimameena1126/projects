# Creating a Form for Customers to Enter Order Details

In this task, we will create a form using HTML and CSS to allow customers to enter their order details. The form will include fields for the order number and email address. Follow the steps below to implement this feature.

## Step 1: Create the HTML Form

Start by creating an HTML file (e.g., `orderForm.html`) where you will define the form structure and fields. Add the following code to create the form:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Order Form</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Order Form</h1>
  <form>
    <div>
      <label for="orderNumber">Order Number:</label>
      <input type="text" id="orderNumber" name="orderNumber" required>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label for="email">Email Address:</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

In this code, we have created a basic HTML form that includes two fields: `orderNumber` and `email`. The `label` elements provide a text description for each field, and the `input` elements allow users to enter their information. The `required` attribute ensures that the fields must be filled out before the form can be submitted.

We have also added a submit button at the end of the form.

## Step 2: Style the Form Using CSS

To enhance the visual appearance of the form, we can add CSS styles. Create a new CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) and add the following code:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  padding: 20px;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

form {
  max-width: 400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

label {
  display: block;
  font-weight: bold;
}

input {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 8px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

button[type="submit"] {
  background-color: #4caf50;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button[type="submit"]:hover {
  background-color: #45a049;
}
```

In this code, we have defined some basic styles for the form and its elements. You can modify the styles to match your project's design requirements.

## Step 3: Test the Form

To test the form, open the `orderForm.html` file in a web browser. You should see the form displayed with the fields and the submit button. Try entering some sample data and submit the form to ensure it functions correctly.

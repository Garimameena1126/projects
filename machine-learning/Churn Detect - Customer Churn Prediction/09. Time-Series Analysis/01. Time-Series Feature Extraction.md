# Time Series Feature Extraction

In this guide, we will explore the task of time series feature extraction as part of the time-series analysis module. Time series feature extraction involves extracting meaningful features from time-dependent data to capture patterns and trends in customer behavior leading up to churn events. By identifying relevant features, we can build more accurate models for churn prediction. We will cover the following steps in this guide:

1. Understanding Time Series Data
2. Preparing the Time Series Data
3. Feature Extraction Techniques
4. Implementing Time Series Feature Extraction
5. Summary

Let's dive into each step in detail.

## 1. Understanding Time Series Data

Time series data is a sequence of data points collected over time. Each data point is associated with a timestamp or time index, allowing us to analyze and model the data with respect to time. In the context of our project, time series data can include customer behavior data recorded at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.

## 2. Preparing the Time Series Data

Before performing feature extraction on time series data, we need to ensure that the data is properly prepared. Follow these steps to prepare the time series data:

### 2.1 Load the Time Series Data

Load the historical customer behavior data, including the timestamps and relevant features, into a suitable data structure such as a Pandas DataFrame in Python. Ensure that the data is sorted in ascending order based on the timestamps.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the time series data into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('customer_behavior.csv')

# Sort the data based on timestamps
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
df = df.sort_values('timestamp')
```

### 2.2 Resampling the Time Series Data

In some cases, the time series data may be recorded at a higher frequency than needed for our analysis. Resampling can help us aggregate the data into a lower frequency while still capturing important trends. For example, we can resample daily data to monthly data or hourly data to daily data.

```python
# Resample the data to a lower frequency (e.g., from daily to monthly)
df_resampled = df.resample('M', on='timestamp').mean()
```

### 2.3 Handling Missing Values

Check for missing values in the time series data and handle them appropriately. Missing values can be filled using techniques such as forward filling, backward filling, or interpolation based on the characteristics of the data.

```python
# Check for missing values
df_resampled.isnull().sum()

# Fill missing values using forward filling
df_resampled = df_resampled.ffill()
```

## 3. Feature Extraction Techniques

Feature extraction from time series data involves deriving new features that capture meaningful patterns, trends, or statistical properties. Here are some commonly used techniques for time series feature extraction:

- Statistical Features: Calculate statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc., over different time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
- Rolling Window Statistics: Compute rolling window statistics such as moving averages, rolling standard deviations, or other aggregations over a specific window size.
- Fourier Transform: Convert the time series data from the time domain to the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform. This can help identify periodic patterns or dominant frequencies.
- Autocorrelation: Compute the autocorrelation function to measure the similarity between a time series and its lagged versions. This can capture the presence of seasonality or trends.
- Seasonal Decomposition: Apply seasonal decomposition techniques such as Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) or Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess (SE

ASONALDECOMP).
- Wavelet Transform: Apply the wavelet transform to analyze the time series at different scales and resolutions, which can reveal details about both high-frequency and low-frequency components.

## 4. Implementing Time Series Feature Extraction

Let's now implement some feature extraction techniques using the resampled time series data from Step 2.2. We will calculate statistical features and rolling window statistics as examples.

### 4.1 Statistical Features

To calculate statistical features over different time intervals, we can use the `resample` function in Pandas combined with aggregation methods such as `mean`, `median`, `std`, `min`, `max`, etc.

```python
# Calculate statistical features over monthly intervals
monthly_stats = df_resampled.resample('M').agg(['mean', 'median', 'std', 'min', 'max'])
```

### 4.2 Rolling Window Statistics

To compute rolling window statistics, we can use the `rolling` function in Pandas combined with aggregation methods. The rolling window can be defined by the window size and the desired aggregation function.

```python
# Calculate rolling window statistics over a window of 7 days
rolling_stats = df_resampled.rolling(window=7).agg(['mean', 'std'])
```

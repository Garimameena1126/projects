In this task, we will focus on displaying the selected packages in the submission confirmation or user dashboard. Follow the steps below to implement this feature.

1. Identify the Display Area
   - Determine where you want to display the selected packages. It could be in the submission confirmation page or the user dashboard.
   - Identify the specific area or component where the selected packages should be rendered.

2. Retrieve the Selected Packages
   - Depending on your project's architecture, retrieve the selected packages from the storage mechanism where they were stored in the previous task (7.3).
   - If the selected packages were associated with the user's account, fetch them based on the user's information or session.
   - Store the retrieved selected packages in a variable for further use.
     ```php
     // PHP example
     $selectedPackages = retrieveSelectedPackagesForUser($user);
     ```

3. Integrate with the Submission Confirmation Page or User Dashboard
   - Locate the relevant file or template where the submission confirmation or user dashboard is implemented.
   - Modify the file to include the logic for displaying the selected packages.
   - Insert the code snippet to render the selected packages in the appropriate location within the page or dashboard.
     ```php
     // PHP example
     <h2>Selected Packages:</h2>
     <ul>
       <?php foreach ($selectedPackages as $package) { ?>
         <li><?php echo $package; ?></li>
       <?php } ?>
     </ul>
     ```

4. Test the Functionality
   - Navigate to the submission confirmation page or user dashboard in your application.
   - Verify that the selected packages are correctly displayed in the designated area.
   - Confirm that the displayed packages match the ones previously selected by the user.

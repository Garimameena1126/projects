# Implementing Functionality to Update the Order Status Using API Requests

In this task, we will focus on implementing the functionality to update the order status using API requests from the frontend. Follow the steps below to incorporate this feature into your project.

## Step 1: Set Up the Frontend Environment

1. Ensure that the frontend project is set up and running. This includes having a working directory with the necessary files for your frontend framework or library (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the frontend project directory.

3. Install any required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

4. Start the frontend development server by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the frontend application and make it accessible at a specified URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Step 2: Update the Frontend UI

1. Open the component or file in your frontend project where you want to implement the order status update functionality (e.g., `OrderDetails.js`).

2. Import any necessary libraries or components to assist with sending API requests from the frontend. For example, if using React, import the required components or functions at the top of your file.

3. Create a form or user interface element to capture the updated order status from the user. This can be a dropdown menu, input field, or any other suitable UI element.

   For example, if using React with a dropdown menu, you might have the following JSX code:

   ```jsx
   <div>
     <label htmlFor="status">Order Status:</label>
     <select id="status" onChange={this.handleStatusChange}>
       <option value="pending">Pending</option>
       <option value="in_progress">In Progress</option>
       <option value="completed">Completed</option>
     </select>
     <button onClick={this.updateOrderStatus}>Update Status</button>
   </div>
   ```

   Adjust the code based on your frontend framework, library, and the UI design of your application.

4. Implement event handlers to capture the selected order status from the user and update the component state accordingly.

   For example, if using React, you might have the following methods:

   ```javascript
   handleStatusChange = (event) => {
     this.setState({ orderStatus: event.target.value });
   };

   updateOrderStatus = () => {
     const { orderId, orderStatus } = this.state;
     // Implement API request to update order status using the selected value
   };
   ```

   Adjust the code based on your specific UI requirements and the structure of your component.

## Step 3: Implement API Request to Update Order Status

1. Utilize the API request library or function provided by your frontend framework or library to send an HTTP request to the backend API and update the order status.

   For example, if using React with `axios` for API requests, you might have the following code:

   ```javascript
   updateOrderStatus = () => {
     const { orderId, orderStatus } = this.state;

     axios
       .put(`http://localhost:8000/api/orders/${orderId}`, { status: orderStatus })
       .then((response) => {
         // Handle the successful response, e.g., show a success message or update the UI
       })
       .catch((error) => {
         // Handle errors, e.g., show an error message or log the error
       });
   };
   ```

   Adjust the code based on your frontend framework, library, and the implementation of your backend API.

2. In the API request, ensure you include the necessary information to identify the order to be updated (e.g., order ID) and the new order status.

   For example, if your backend API expects the order ID in the URL path and the updated status in the request body, adjust the URL and request payload accordingly.

## Step 4: Test and Verify the Functionality

1. Save the changes made to your frontend code.

2. Start or restart the frontend development server if necessary.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend application.

4. Locate the section or component where you implemented the order status update functionality.

5. Interact with the UI element you created (e.g., select a new status from the dropdown menu and click the "Update Status" button).

6. Verify that the API request is successfully sent to the backend and the order status is updated accordingly.

7. Check the backend logs or database to ensure the order status is persistently updated.

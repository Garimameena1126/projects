
## Display Discounted Total Amount to the User

In this guide, we will implement the necessary steps to display the discounted total amount to the user after applying the coupon code.

### Step 1: Identify the Discounted Total Element

1. Open the cart page HTML file (e.g., `cart.html`) in your project.
2. Locate the element where you want to display the discounted total amount.
3. Assign an ID to the element for easy access from JavaScript.

```html
<h3>Discounted Total: <span id="discountedTotal"></span></h3>
```

### Step 2: Update Cart Total with Discounted Amount

1. Assuming you have already implemented the logic to apply the discount to the cart total as described in the previous guide, you can leverage that code.
2. Modify the `applyDiscountToCartTotal` function to update the discounted total element in addition to subtracting the discount amount.

```javascript
function applyDiscountToCartTotal(discount) {
  const currentTotal = parseFloat(document.getElementById('cartTotal').innerText);
  const discountedTotal = currentTotal - discount;
  document.getElementById('cartTotal').innerText = discountedTotal.toFixed(2);

  // Update the discounted total element
  document.getElementById('discountedTotal').innerText = discountedTotal.toFixed(2);
}
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Discounted Total

1. To ensure the discounted total is displayed correctly when the cart page loads, you can invoke the `applyDiscountToCartTotal` function with the initial discount amount (if applicable) during the page initialization.
2. Modify your existing code that retrieves the discount amount to call the `applyDiscountToCartTotal` function with the discount amount.

```javascript
// Assuming you have retrieved the discount amount from the server
const discount = 10.0; // Example discount amount

// Apply the discount to the cart total and display the discounted total
applyDiscountToCartTotal(discount);
```

### Step 4: Style the Discounted Total Element (Optional)

1. If desired, you can apply CSS styles to the discounted total element to make it visually distinct or more prominent.
2. Open your project's CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) or add a `<style>` block in the cart page HTML file.
3. Target the discounted total element using its ID and specify the desired styles.

```css
#discountedTotal {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: green;
}
```

In this guide, we will explore how to implement server-side validation to ensure that only allowed file types and sizes are accepted during file uploads.

## Step 1: Set Up the Server-Side Environment

1. Ensure that you have a server-side environment set up for your project. This can be a backend framework like Node.js with Express, Django, Ruby on Rails, or any other server-side technology of your choice.
2. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies or libraries installed to handle file uploads and perform validation.

## Step 2: Define Allowed File Types and Sizes

1. Determine the file types (extensions) and sizes that are allowed for upload in your application. This can be based on your specific requirements and security considerations.
2. Create a configuration or constant in your server-side code that lists the allowed file types and their corresponding maximum sizes. Here's an example in Node.js:

```javascript
const ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES = ['.pdf', '.doc', '.docx'];
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB
```

## Step 3: Modify the File Upload Endpoint

1. Locate the server-side route or endpoint that handles file uploads.
2. Add code to perform validation before processing the uploaded file. Here's an example using Node.js with Express:

```javascript
app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  const uploadedFile = req.file;

  // Validate the file type
  const fileExtension = path.extname(uploadedFile.originalname).toLowerCase();
  if (!ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES.includes(fileExtension)) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid file type' });
  }

  // Validate the file size
  if (uploadedFile.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'File size exceeds the limit' });
  }

  // Process the file if it passes validation
  // ...
});
```

## Step 4: Return Appropriate Error Responses

1. When the file type or size validation fails, return an appropriate error response to the client. This can be an HTTP status code and a corresponding error message.
2. Update the client-side code to handle these error responses and display them to the user.

## Step 5: Test the Server-Side Validation

1. Start your server and test the file upload functionality with various file types and sizes.
2. Verify that files with allowed types and sizes are accepted, while files with disallowed types or sizes are rejected with the appropriate error responses.


## Dynamically Generating Product Cards

1. Open the HTML file where you want to display the product cards. This could be the landing page or any other relevant page.

2. Ensure you have already fetched the product data from the JSON file using the steps provided in the previous guide.

3. Identify an HTML element within your page where you want to dynamically generate the product cards. For example, you can use a `<div>` element with a specific ID. Let's assume the ID is "product-container".

   ```html
   <div id="product-container"></div>
   ```

4. Create a JavaScript function that will generate the product cards based on the fetched data. You can name it `generateProductCards()`.

   ```javascript
   function generateProductCards(data) {
     const productContainer = document.getElementById('product-container');

     // Iterate through the data and generate a card for each product
     data.forEach(product => {
       const card = createProductCard(product);
       productContainer.appendChild(card);
     });
   }
   ```

   In this example, we assume that the fetched data is an array of objects, where each object represents a product. The `generateProductCards()` function takes this data as an argument.

5. Inside the `generateProductCards()` function, we access the product container element using its ID. In this case, we use `document.getElementById('product-container')` to obtain a reference to the element.

6. Next, we iterate through the fetched data using a `forEach` loop. For each product, we create a product card by calling the `createProductCard()` function and passing the product as an argument.

7. Create another JavaScript function named `createProductCard(product)` to generate a single product card based on the provided product object.

   ```javascript
   function createProductCard(product) {
     const card = document.createElement('div');
     card.classList.add('product-card');

     // Set the content of the product card
     card.innerHTML = `
       <img src="${product.image}" alt="${product.name}" class="product-image">
       <h3 class="product-name">${product.name}</h3>
       <p class="product-price">$${product.price}</p>
     `;

     return card;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `createProductCard()` function takes a product object as an argument.

8. Inside the `createProductCard()` function, we create a new `<div>` element using `document.createElement('div')` and add the CSS class "product-card" to it using `classList.add('product-card')`.

9. Using the `innerHTML` property of the card element, we set the content of the product card. This includes an image element displaying the product image, an `<h3>` element for the product name, and a `<p>` element for the product price. We use template literals to dynamically insert the product data.

10. Finally, the `createProductCard()` function returns the card element.

11. To trigger the generation of product cards, call the `generateProductCards()` function and pass the fetched data as an argument. You can call this function after the data is successfully fetched.

   ```javascript
   // Assuming you have already fetched the data
   generateProductCards(data);
   ```

12. Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser.

## Summary

In this guide, you learned how to dynamically generate product cards on the landing page using the fetched data. Here's a summary of the steps:

1. Open your HTML file where you want to display the product cards.
2. Ensure you have already fetched

 the product data from the JSON file.
3. Identify an HTML element where you want to generate the product cards.
4. Create a JavaScript function, `generateProductCards()`, to generate the cards.
5. Access the product container element using its ID.
6. Iterate through the fetched data and create a card for each product.
7. Create a JavaScript function, `createProductCard()`, to generate a single product card.
8. Create a `<div>` element for the card and add necessary CSS classes.
9. Set the content of the product card using the product data.
10. Return the card element from the `createProductCard()` function.
11. Call the `generateProductCards()` function with the fetched data.
12. Save and view your HTML file in a web browser to see the dynamically generated product cards.

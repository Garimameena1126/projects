## Updating the Displayed Itinerary with New Activity Information

In this guide, we will implement the functionality to update the displayed itinerary with the new activity information. This will ensure that the newly added activity is reflected in the user interface.

### Step 1: Identify the DOM Element for Displaying Itinerary Details

1. Identify the HTML element or elements that display the itinerary details, such as the itinerary name, dates, and existing activities.
2. Assign a unique identifier or class name to these elements to easily target them in JavaScript.

For example, if you have a `<div>` element with the ID `itinerary-details` that displays the itinerary details, you can select it using JavaScript as follows:

```javascript
const itineraryDetailsElement = document.getElementById('itinerary-details');
```

### Step 2: Update the Displayed Itinerary with the New Activity Information

1. Retrieve the necessary information from the new activity object, such as the activity name, location, and time.
2. Update the HTML content of the itinerary details element to include the new activity information.

```javascript
const activityName = newActivity.name;
const activityLocation = newActivity.location;
const activityTime = newActivity.time;

itineraryDetailsElement.innerHTML += `
  <p><strong>Activity Name:</strong> ${activityName}</p>
  <p><strong>Location:</strong> ${activityLocation}</p>
  <p><strong>Time:</strong> ${activityTime}</p>
`;
```

In the above code, we assume that the `itineraryDetailsElement` is a `<div>` element that already contains the existing itinerary details. By using the `+=` operator, we append the new activity information to the existing content.

### Step 3: Test the Functionality

1. Save your JavaScript file.
2. Trigger the necessary events or interactions to add a new activity to an existing itinerary.
3. Verify that the displayed itinerary is updated with the new activity information by inspecting the user interface.

For example, if you have a button or form submission that adds a new activity, clicking that button or submitting the form should update the displayed itinerary with the new activity details.

### Step 4: Styling and Formatting (Optional)

1. Apply appropriate CSS styles to the added activity information to ensure it is visually distinguishable from the existing itinerary details.
2. Format the added activity information according to your desired layout and design.

You can use CSS classes or inline styles to customize the appearance of the new activity information.

```javascript
itineraryDetailsElement.innerHTML += `
  <p class="activity-name"><strong>Activity Name:</strong> ${activityName}</p>
  <p class="activity-location"><strong>Location:</strong> ${activityLocation}</p>
  <p class="activity-time"><strong>Time:</strong> ${activityTime}</p>
`;
```

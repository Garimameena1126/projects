# Task: Implement a Feature to Populate Exercise Details Based on Selected Exercises

In this task, we will focus on implementing a feature that allows the user to select an exercise from the UI and populate exercise details based on the selected exercise. This will involve retrieving additional information about the exercise from the fitness API and displaying it in the UI. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Step 1: Capture Exercise Selection

Ensure that you have already implemented the functionality to capture exercise selections from the UI. This could be done through an event listener attached to the exercise suggestions container, as explained in the previous task.

```javascript
// JavaScript event handling for exercise selection
const suggestionsContainer = document.getElementById('exercise-suggestions');

suggestionsContainer.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  const selectedExercise = event.target.textContent;
  handleExerciseSelection(selectedExercise);
});
```

In this example, the `handleExerciseSelection` function is called with the selected exercise name as a parameter.

## Step 2: Retrieve Exercise Details from API

Using the selected exercise, make an API call to retrieve additional details about the exercise. This could include information such as the number of sets, repetitions, equipment needed, and so on.

```javascript
function fetchExerciseDetails(exerciseName) {
  // Make an API call to retrieve exercise details
  // Replace 'API_URL' with the actual URL of the fitness API endpoint
  fetch(`API_URL/exercises/${exerciseName}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      // Process the retrieved exercise details
      handleExerciseDetails(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      // Handle any errors that occur during the API call
      console.error('Error retrieving exercise details:', error);
    });
}
```

In this example, we use the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the fitness API endpoint that provides exercise details. Replace `'API_URL'` with the actual URL of your fitness API endpoint. Once the data is retrieved successfully, the `handleExerciseDetails` function is called with the exercise details as a parameter.

## Step 3: Process Exercise Details

In the `handleExerciseDetails` function, process the retrieved exercise details and update the UI to display the information to the user.

```javascript
function handleExerciseDetails(exerciseDetails) {
  // Access the exercise details and update the UI accordingly
  const exerciseNameElement = document.getElementById('exercise-name');
  const exerciseSetsElement = document.getElementById('exercise-sets');
  const exerciseRepsElement = document.getElementById('exercise-reps');

  exerciseNameElement.textContent = exerciseDetails.name;
  exerciseSetsElement.textContent = exerciseDetails.sets;
  exerciseRepsElement.textContent = exerciseDetails.repetitions;
}
```

In this example, the `exerciseDetails` object contains properties such as `name`, `sets`, and `repetitions`. These properties can be accessed and used to update specific elements in the UI with the corresponding exercise details.

## Step 4: Update the UI

Ensure that you have HTML elements in your UI to display the exercise details. These elements can be updated dynamically based on the selected exercise and its associated details.

```html
<!-- HTML exercise details container -->
<div id="exercise-details">
  <h2 id="exercise-name"></h2>
  <p>Sets: <span id="exercise-sets"></span></p>
  <p>Reps: <span id="exercise-reps"></span></p>
</div>
```

In this example, the exercise details container consists of an `<h2>` element to display the exercise name, and `<p>` elements to display the number of sets and repetitions.

## Step 5: Styling the Exercise Details

To

 enhance the visual presentation of the exercise details, apply appropriate CSS styles to the elements. Customize the styles based on your project's design requirements.

```css
/* CSS styles for exercise details */
#exercise-details {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
  margin-top: 10px;
}

#exercise-name {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

#exercise-sets,
#exercise-reps {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

In this example, the exercise details container has a border, padding, and margin to separate it from other UI elements. The exercise name is styled with a larger font size and bold text, while the sets and reps are styled with a smaller font size.

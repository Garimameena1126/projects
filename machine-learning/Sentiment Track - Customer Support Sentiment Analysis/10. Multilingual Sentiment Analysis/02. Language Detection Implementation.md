# Implementing Language Detection Functionality

In this task, we will add language detection functionality to automatically identify the language of customer support messages. This feature will help us extend the sentiment analysis model to support multiple languages.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- scikit-learn library (for language detection)

## Step 1: Installing the Required Libraries

First, we need to install the necessary libraries for language detection. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

This will install the scikit-learn library, which includes language detection capabilities.

## Step 2: Loading the Language Detection Model

In this step, we will load the pre-trained language detection model provided by scikit-learn. This model has been trained on a large corpus of text in various languages and can predict the language of a given text.

Open your Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python IDE) and import the required libraries:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
```

Next, load the language detection model by creating a pipeline with a CountVectorizer and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier:

```python
# Create the language detection pipeline
language_detection_model = make_pipeline(
    CountVectorizer(),
    MultinomialNB()
)
```

## Step 3: Training the Language Detection Model

Now, we need to train the language detection model using a labeled dataset of texts in different languages. The dataset should contain text samples along with their corresponding language labels.

Let's assume you have a CSV file named `language_dataset.csv` with two columns: `text` and `language`. Each row represents a text sample and its associated language.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the labeled dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('language_dataset.csv')

# Split the dataset into features (text) and labels (language)
text_data = dataset['text']
language_labels = dataset['language']

# Train the language detection model
language_detection_model.fit(text_data, language_labels)
```

By running the code above, the language detection model will learn to associate patterns in the text with specific languages.

## Step 4: Using the Language Detection Model

Now that we have trained the language detection model, we can use it to automatically identify the language of customer support messages.

Let's assume you have a customer support message stored in a variable named `message`. To detect the language of this message, use the following code:

```python
# Detect the language of the customer support message
detected_language = language_detection_model.predict([message])[0]

print("Detected Language:", detected_language)
```

The `predict` method takes a list of messages as input and returns a list of predicted language labels. Since we are predicting the language for a single message, we wrap it in a list (`[message]`) and access the first element of the predicted labels (`[0]`).

The detected language will be printed to the console.

## Step 5: Integration with Sentiment Analysis

To integrate the language detection functionality with the sentiment analysis model, you can modify the API endpoint implementation from Module 4. Let's assume you have an API endpoint `/analyze` that receives customer support messages as input.

Inside the endpoint logic, you can add the language detection code before passing the message to the sentiment analysis model. Here's an example:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# API endpoint for sentiment analysis
@app.route('/analyze', methods

=['POST'])
def analyze_sentiment():
    # Get the customer support message from the request
    message = request.json['message']

    # Detect the language of the message
    detected_language = language_detection_model.predict([message])[0]

    # Perform sentiment analysis based on the detected language
    # ... your sentiment analysis code here ...

    # Return the predicted sentiment label and detected language
    response = {
        'sentiment': predicted_sentiment,
        'language': detected_language
    }

    return jsonify(response)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In the above code snippet, we added the language detection code before performing sentiment analysis. The detected language is then included in the API response along with the predicted sentiment label.

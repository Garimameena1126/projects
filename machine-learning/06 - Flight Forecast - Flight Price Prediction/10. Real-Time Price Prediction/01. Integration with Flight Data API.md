# Module 10: Real-Time Price Prediction (Optional)

In this module, we will extend our project to provide real-time flight price predictions by integrating with an API that provides up-to-date flight data. We will implement a data retrieval mechanism to fetch the latest flight details and use the trained model to predict the current prices. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Choose an API for Flight Data

The first step is to choose an API that provides up-to-date flight data. There are several APIs available for this purpose, such as Skyscanner, Amadeus, or FlightAware. You need to sign up for an account and obtain the necessary API credentials to access the flight data.

For the purpose of this guide, we will use the Skyscanner API. Sign up for a free account on the Skyscanner Developer Portal and obtain the API key.

## Step 2: Install Required Libraries

To interact with the API and handle the real-time flight data, we need to install some libraries. Open your command-line interface and run the following command to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Step 3: Create a Function to Retrieve Flight Data

Next, we need to create a function that retrieves the flight data from the API. In this example, we will create a Python function called `get_flight_data()`.

```python
import requests

def get_flight_data(api_key, origin, destination):
    base_url = "https://partners.api.skyscanner.net/apiservices/browseroutes/v1.0"
    headers = {"Accept": "application/json", "apiKey": api_key}

    params = {
        "country": "US",
        "currency": "USD",
        "locale": "en-US",
        "originplace": origin,
        "destinationplace": destination,
        "outboundpartialdate": "anytime",
        "inboundpartialdate": "anytime",
    }

    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/US/USD/en-US/{origin}/{destination}/anytime/anytime", headers=headers, params=params)
    data = response.json()

    return data
```

In the above code, we are making a GET request to the Skyscanner API using the provided API key, origin airport code, and destination airport code. The API will return the flight data in JSON format.

## Step 4: Parse and Preprocess the Flight Data

Once we have retrieved the flight data, we need to parse and preprocess it to prepare it for prediction using our trained model. In this step, we will extract the relevant features from the API response and preprocess them in a similar way as we did in the previous modules.

```python
import pandas as pd

def preprocess_flight_data(data):
    quotes = data["Quotes"]
    places = data["Places"]
    carriers = data["Carriers"]

    quotes_df = pd.DataFrame(quotes)
    places_df = pd.DataFrame(places)
    carriers_df = pd.DataFrame(carriers)

    # Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values,
    # encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling

    # ...

    return preprocessed_data
```

In the above code, we extract the quotes, places, and carriers from the API response and convert them into pandas DataFrames. You can perform additional preprocessing steps based on your project requirements.

## Step 5: Make Real-Time Predictions

Now that we have the preprocessed flight data, we can use our trained model to make real-time predictions. Assuming you have already trained a model in the previous modules, we will load the saved model and use it for predictions.

```python
import joblib

def load_model(model_path):
    return joblib.load(model_path)



def predict_flight_prices(model, data):
    # Perform necessary preprocessing steps on data

    # ...

    # Use the trained model to make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(data)

    return predictions
```

In the above code, we define two functions: `load_model()` to load the trained model from a saved file, and `predict_flight_prices()` to make predictions using the loaded model.

## Step 6: Test the Real-Time Price Prediction

To test the real-time price prediction, we can create a simple command-line application where users can input flight details, and our model will predict the corresponding price.

```python
def main():
    # Load the trained model
    model = load_model("path_to_saved_model")

    # Get user input for flight details
    origin = input("Enter origin airport code: ")
    destination = input("Enter destination airport code: ")

    # Retrieve flight data from the API
    api_key = "your_api_key"
    data = get_flight_data(api_key, origin, destination)

    # Preprocess the flight data
    preprocessed_data = preprocess_flight_data(data)

    # Make real-time predictions
    predictions = predict_flight_prices(model, preprocessed_data)

    # Display the predicted price
    print("Predicted flight price:", predictions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the above code, we define the `main()` function to orchestrate the real-time price prediction process. The user is prompted to enter the origin and destination airport codes, and the corresponding flight data is retrieved from the API. The data is then preprocessed and used to make real-time predictions using our trained model.

That's it! You have successfully extended your project to provide real-time flight price predictions using an API. Users can now input flight details, and your model will predict the current prices based on the latest data from the API.

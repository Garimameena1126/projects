In this guide, we will walk through the steps to implement authorization checks in your project to restrict access to certain features or routes based on user roles.

### Step 1: Define User Roles

1. Identify the different user roles that exist in your system. For example, you may have roles such as "admin" and "regular user".
2. Decide on the access privileges and permissions associated with each role.

### Step 2: Store User Roles

1. In your user database or user model, add a field to store the user's role.
2. When registering a new user, provide an option to select the user's role. Alternatively, you can assign a default role for all new users.

Example:
```markdown
```javascript
// User model
const UserSchema = new Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, default: 'regular user' },
});
```

### Step 3: Implement Role-Based Authorization Checks

1. Identify the routes or features in your application that need to be restricted based on user roles.
2. Add an authorization check middleware or function to verify the user's role before allowing access to the protected route or feature.
3. If the user's role does not have the required permission, return an error or redirect them to an appropriate page.

Example:
```markdown
```javascript
// Authorization middleware
function authorize(role) {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    // Get the authenticated user from the session or token
    const user = req.user;

    if (!user || user.role !== role) {
      // User is not authorized
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access forbidden' });
    }

    // User is authorized, proceed to the next middleware or route handler
    next();
  };
}

// Protected route example
app.get('/admin/dashboard', authorize('admin'), (req, res) => {
  // Handle admin dashboard request
});
```

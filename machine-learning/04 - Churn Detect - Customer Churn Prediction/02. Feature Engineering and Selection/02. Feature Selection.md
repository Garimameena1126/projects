# Module 2: Feature Engineering and Selection

In this module, we will focus on performing feature engineering and selecting the most relevant features for the churn prediction task. Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of our model. Feature selection helps us identify the subset of features that have the most impact on predicting customer churn. We will explore techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance from a tree-based model to guide our feature selection process.

## Step 1: Load the Dataset

Before we begin feature engineering and selection, we need to load the dataset containing the historical customer data from the e-commerce SAAS company. Ensure that you have the dataset file (e.g., CSV or Excel file) available locally. We will use popular Python libraries such as pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_dataset.csv')
```

Replace `'path_to_dataset.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset file.

## Step 2: Explore the Dataset

To gain a better understanding of the dataset and its variables, let's perform some initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). This will help us identify the features that are available and potential areas for feature engineering. Some of the key exploratory tasks include:

- Checking the dimensions of the dataset:
```python
# Check the dimensions of the dataset
print("Dataset shape:", data.shape)
```

- Viewing the first few rows of the dataset:
```python
# View the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
```

- Obtaining summary statistics of the dataset:
```python
# Get summary statistics of the dataset
print(data.describe())
```

- Checking the data types of the features:
```python
# Check the data types of the features
print(data.dtypes)
```

- Identifying missing values in the dataset:
```python
# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())
```

- Exploring the distribution of the target variable (churn):
```python
# Count the number of churned and non-churned customers
print(data['churn'].value_counts())
```

Analyze the output of these EDA tasks to get a better understanding of the dataset and the target variable.

## Step 3: Perform Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of our model. Let's explore some common feature engineering techniques:

- **Creating New Features**: Consider creating new features that might capture important information for predicting churn. For example, you could calculate the total number of interactions a customer has had with the platform or the average time spent on the platform per session. Here's an example of creating a new feature called `total_interactions`:
```python
# Create a new feature: total_interactions
data['total_interactions'] = data['feature1'] + data['feature2'] + data['feature3']
```

- **Transforming Existing Features**: Transforming features can help uncover nonlinear relationships or make the data more suitable for modeling. Some common transformations include logarithmic, square root, or reciprocal transformations. Here's an example of applying a logarithmic transformation to a feature called `feature1`:
```python
# Apply logarithmic transformation to feature1
data['feature1_log'] = np.log(data['feature1'])
```

Experiment with different feature engineering techniques that are relevant to your dataset and domain knowledge. Keep track of the new features created and the transformations applied.

## Step 4: Calculate Feature Importance

To select the most relevant features for the churn prediction task, we can calculate feature importance using various techniques. One popular approach is to use feature importance derived from a tree-based model

. In this example, we will use a Random Forest classifier to calculate feature importance:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Separate features and target variable
X = data.drop('churn', axis=1)
y = data['churn']

# Initialize a Random Forest classifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier()

# Fit the classifier to the data
rf.fit(X, y)

# Get feature importance
importance = rf.feature_importances_

# Create a dataframe to display feature importance
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': X.columns, 'Importance': importance})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('Importance', ascending=False)
print(feature_importance)
```

The output will display the features ranked by their importance scores. Higher importance scores indicate more influential features for predicting churn.

## Step 5: Select Relevant Features

Based on the feature importance scores and domain knowledge, we can select the most relevant features for the churn prediction task. You can set a threshold or choose a fixed number of features to retain. Let's select the top 10 features for demonstration purposes:

```python
# Select the top 10 features
selected_features = feature_importance['Feature'][:10].tolist()

# Create a new dataframe with only the selected features and the target variable
selected_data = data[selected_features + ['churn']]
```

The `selected_data` dataframe will contain only the top 10 features and the churn variable, which will be used for the subsequent modeling tasks.

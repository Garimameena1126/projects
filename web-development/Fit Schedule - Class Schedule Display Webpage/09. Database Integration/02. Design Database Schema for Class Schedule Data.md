1. Choose a suitable database system: In this guide, we will use MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, for its flexibility and ease of use. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your system.

2. Determine the entities and their relationships: Based on the requirements, we need to accommodate class names, timings, instructors, and additional details. Let's consider the following entities:
   - Class: Represents a fitness class with attributes such as class name, timing, instructor, and additional details.
   - Instructor: Represents an instructor with attributes like name, bio, and contact information.

3. Design the Class schema:
   - Open your preferred text editor or MongoDB GUI tool.
   - Create a new file or open the MongoDB shell.
   - Define the schema for the Class entity. For example, you can use the following structure in the MongoDB shell:

```javascript
use fitness_app; // Assuming you want to create the schema in a database named "fitness_app"

db.createCollection("classes");

db.classes.insertOne({
   name: "Yoga",
   timing: "Mon, Wed, Fri 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM",
   instructor: "John Doe",
   details: "A relaxing yoga class suitable for all levels."
});
```

Explanation:
- We use the `use` statement to switch to the "fitness_app" database. If the database doesn't exist, it will be created.
- The `createCollection` command creates a collection named "classes" within the "fitness_app" database to store the class-related information.
- The `insertOne` command inserts a sample document into the "classes" collection, representing a yoga class. It includes attributes like `name`, `timing`, `instructor`, and `details`. Feel free to add more sample documents or modify the existing one based on your requirements.

4. Design the Instructor schema:
   - Similarly, define the schema for the Instructor entity. For example, you can use the following structure in the MongoDB shell:

```javascript
db.createCollection("instructors");

db.instructors.insertOne({
   name: "John Doe",
   bio: "Certified yoga instructor with 10 years of experience.",
   contact: {
      email: "john@example.com",
      phone: "+1 (555) 123-4567"
   }
});
```

Explanation:
- The `createCollection` command creates a collection named "instructors" within the "fitness_app" database to store instructor-related information.
- The `insertOne` command inserts a sample document into the "instructors" collection, representing an instructor named John Doe. It includes attributes like `name`, `bio`, and `contact` (which itself contains email and phone attributes). You can add more instructors or modify the existing document as needed.

5. Establish the relationship between Class and Instructor:
   - In the Class schema, instead of storing the instructor name as a string, you can reference the corresponding instructor document using their unique identifier. For example, modify the sample class document as follows:

```javascript
db.classes.insertOne({
   name: "Yoga",
   timing: "Mon, Wed, Fri 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM",
   instructor: ObjectId("<instructor_id>"), // Replace <instructor_id> with the corresponding instructor's ObjectId
   details: "A relaxing yoga class suitable for all levels."
});
```

Explanation:
- The `ObjectId` type is a unique

 identifier generated by MongoDB for each document. Replace `<instructor_id>` with the actual ObjectId of the instructor you want to associate with the yoga class.

6. Save the changes and test the schema:
   - Save the modifications made in the text editor or exit the MongoDB shell.
   - You have now designed the database schema to accommodate class names, timings, instructors, and additional details.

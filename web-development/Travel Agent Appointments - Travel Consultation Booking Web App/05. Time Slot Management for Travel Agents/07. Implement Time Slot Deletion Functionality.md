1. **Open the server-side code**: Locate the file or module where you handle the server-side routes or controllers. This is typically where you define the routes and their corresponding logic.

2. **Define a route for handling time slot deletion**: Inside the server-side code, define a new route that will handle the deletion of time slots. This route should listen for HTTP DELETE requests to a specific endpoint.

   ```javascript
   // Assuming you're using Express.js
   app.delete('/timeslots/:id', (req, res) => {
     // Handle the time slot deletion logic
   });
   ```

   In the example above, the route is defined with the endpoint `/timeslots/:id` and is set to handle DELETE requests. The `:id` parameter represents the unique identifier of the time slot to be deleted.

3. **Retrieve the time slot ID**: Within the route's callback function, retrieve the time slot ID from the request parameters. This ID will be used to identify the specific time slot that the travel agent wants to delete.

   ```javascript
   const timeSlotId = req.params.id;
   ```

4. **Find and remove the time slot**: Using the retrieved time slot ID, locate the corresponding time slot in the database and remove it.

   ```javascript
   const TimeSlot = require('../models/TimeSlot');

   TimeSlot.findByIdAndRemove(timeSlotId)
     .then(() => {
       // Time slot removed successfully
       res.status(200).json({ message: 'Time slot deleted successfully.' });
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Handle the error
       res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to delete the time slot.' });
     });
   ```

   In the code above, the `TimeSlot` model represents the schema and model for time slots. The `findByIdAndRemove` method is used to locate and remove the time slot with the specified ID. Handle success and error cases accordingly.

5. **Handle server errors**: If any errors occur during the time slot deletion process, handle them appropriately and provide meaningful error responses to the client.

   ```javascript
   // Assuming an error occurred while deleting the time slot
   res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while deleting the time slot.' });
   ```

   Adjust the error handling code based on your server-side setup and error handling approach.

6. **Test the route**: Test the route using a tool like Postman or by making a DELETE request from the frontend, providing the time slot ID to be deleted. Ensure that the route properly handles the deletion of time slots and provides the expected response.

To add pagination functionality to your lead list and handle a large number of leads, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Determine the Number of Leads per Page

Decide on the number of leads you want to display per page. This will help you split the list into manageable chunks and present them to the user.

For example, you may choose to display 10 leads per page. This means that if you have 100 leads in total, you will have 10 pages with 10 leads on each page.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Pages

Based on the total number of leads and the number of leads per page determined in the previous step, calculate the total number of pages.

Divide the total number of leads by the number of leads per page and round up to the nearest integer to handle any remainder.

```python
total_leads = 100
leads_per_page = 10
total_pages = math.ceil(total_leads / leads_per_page)
```

In this example, the total number of pages would be 10.

#### Step 3: Modify the Database Query

Update your database query to retrieve only a subset of leads based on the selected page. This will involve incorporating the pagination logic into your query.

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, phone FROM leads LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

The `LIMIT` keyword specifies the number of leads per page, and the `OFFSET` keyword determines the starting position of the leads on the current page.

#### Step 4: Capture the Current Page Number

Capture the current page number selected by the user. This can be obtained through user interaction, such as clicking on page navigation links or using a dropdown menu.

Ensure that you retrieve and store the selected page number in a variable that you can use in the next step.

#### Step 5: Calculate the Offset

Using the current page number and the number of leads per page, calculate the offset value to determine the starting position of the leads for the current page.

```python
current_page = 3
offset = (current_page - 1) * leads_per_page
```

In this example, if the current page is 3 and there are 10 leads per page, the offset value would be 20.

#### Step 6: Modify the Query with Pagination Parameters

Using the offset value calculated in the previous step, update your database query dynamically to include the pagination parameters.

For example:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email, phone FROM leads LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

Ensure that you inject the appropriate values into the query based on the current page number and the leads per page.

#### Step 7: Execute the Modified Query

Execute the modified query against the database to retrieve the leads for the current page.

Refer to the documentation or appropriate guides for your chosen database driver or library to learn how to execute the modified query with pagination parameters.

#### Step 8: Display Paginated Leads

Present the retrieved leads for the current page to the user. This can be done by rendering the leads in a table or a list.

Consider using a template engine or your chosen programming language's features to dynamically generate the pagination links or controls to navigate between different pages.

#### Step 9: Test and Verify

Test your application and interact with the pagination functionality to ensure that the leads are displayed correctly for each page.

Verify that the pagination links or controls are working as expected and that the correct leads are shown based on the selected page number.

Make any necessary adjustments to the user interface or integration code if the pagination behavior is not as desired.

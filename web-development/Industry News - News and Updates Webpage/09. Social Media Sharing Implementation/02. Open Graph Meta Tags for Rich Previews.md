In this task, we will implement Open Graph meta tags in the project to provide rich previews when sharing articles on social media platforms.

### Step 1: Understand Open Graph Protocol

1. Familiarize yourself with the Open Graph Protocol, which is a set of tags that allows you to control how your website content is displayed when shared on social media.
2. Open Graph meta tags provide specific information about the shared content, such as the title, description, image, and URL.

### Step 2: Identify Relevant Content for Open Graph Tags

1. Determine the specific content you want to display in the rich previews when sharing articles.
   - For example, you may want to include the article title, a brief description, an image, and the article's URL.

### Step 3: Add Open Graph Meta Tags to Your HTML

1. Open the HTML head section of your project's index.html or the relevant file for the article page.
2. Add the necessary Open Graph meta tags inside the head section.
   - Use the `property` attribute to specify the Open Graph property, such as `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, and `og:url`.
   - Set the `content` attribute of each meta tag to the corresponding value from your article content.
   - For example:
     ```html
     <meta property="og:title" content="Your Article Title">
     <meta property="og:description" content="A brief description of your article.">
     <meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/article-image.jpg">
     <meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/article-url">
     ```

### Step 4: Test the Open Graph Meta Tags

1. Start your project and navigate to an article page in the browser.
2. Open a social media sharing preview debugger tool, such as the Facebook Sharing Debugger or the Twitter Card Validator.
3. Enter the URL of the article page and check the preview generated by the social media platform.
   - Verify that the title, description, image, and URL are displayed correctly.
   - Make any necessary adjustments to the Open Graph meta tags in your code if the preview does not appear as expected.

### Step 5: Customize Open Graph Meta Tags for Different Articles

1. If your project has multiple articles or dynamic content, make sure to dynamically generate the Open Graph meta tags for each article.
2. Retrieve the relevant article information from your data source or API.
3. Update the values of the Open Graph meta tags using the dynamic content.
   - You can use server-side rendering or JavaScript to update the meta tags based on the currently displayed article.

In this task, we will evaluate the performance of the trained machine learning model by calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics. These metrics help us understand how well the model's predictions align with the actual flight prices.

### Step 1: Prepare the Data

Before evaluating the model, make sure you have the following data ready:
- **X_test**: Feature vectors of the testing dataset.
- **y_test**: Actual flight prices corresponding to the testing dataset.

### Step 2: Import Required Libraries

Start by importing the necessary libraries for calculating the evaluation metrics. In this guide, we will use scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
```

### Step 3: Load the Trained Model

Load the trained machine learning model that you want to evaluate. Ensure that the model has already been trained using the training dataset.

```python
from sklearn.externals import joblib

# Load the trained model from disk
model = joblib.load('trained_model.pkl')
```

### Step 4: Make Predictions

Using the loaded model, make predictions on the testing dataset (**X_test**). The predicted flight prices will be used for evaluation.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Step 5: Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted flight prices and the actual flight prices. It provides a straightforward interpretation of the model's performance.

```python
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Absolute Error (MAE):", mae)
```

### Step 6: Calculate Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RMSE represents the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted flight prices and the actual flight prices. It penalizes larger errors more than MAE, making it a useful metric for assessing model performance.

```python
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):", rmse)
```

### Step 7: Interpret the Results

The calculated MAE and RMSE values indicate how well the trained model performed in predicting flight prices. Lower values of both metrics indicate better performance. Compare these values with the context of your specific project and evaluate the model accordingly.

# Model Comparison and Selection

In this task, we will compare the performance of multiple regression models and select the most accurate model for predicting calorie intake. We will consider three popular regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network. By evaluating and comparing the performance of these models, we can determine which one provides the best predictions.

## Step 1: Splitting the Data

Before we can train and evaluate the models, we need to split our preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the models, while the testing set will be used to assess their performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = preprocessed_data.drop('calorie_intake', axis=1)
y = preprocessed_data['calorie_intake']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

In the code snippet above, we use the `train_test_split` function from the scikit-learn library to split the data into training and testing sets. We assign 80% of the data to the training set (`X_train` and `y_train`) and 20% to the testing set (`X_test` and `y_test`).

## Step 2: Training and Evaluating the Models

Now, we will train the three regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network) using the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

### Linear Regression

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error

# Create a Linear Regression model
linear_model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
linear_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
linear_predictions = linear_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
linear_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, linear_predictions)
linear_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, linear_predictions, squared=False)

print(f"Linear Regression - Mean Absolute Error: {linear_mae}")
print(f"Linear Regression - Root Mean Squared Error: {linear_rmse}")
```

In the code above, we import the necessary classes from scikit-learn. We create an instance of the `LinearRegression` class and train the model using the training data. Next, we make predictions on the testing set and calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) using the predicted values and the true values from the testing set.

### Decision Tree

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Create a Decision Tree model
tree_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=42)

# Train the model
tree_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
tree_predictions = tree_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
tree_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, tree_predictions)
tree_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, tree_predictions, squared=False)

print(f"Decision Tree - Mean Absolute Error: {tree_mae}")
print(f"Decision Tree - Root Mean Squared Error: {tree_rmse}")
```

Here, we import the `DecisionTreeRegressor` class and create an instance of the model. We train the model using the training data and make predictions on the testing set. Finally, we calculate the MAE and RMSE to evaluate the model's performance.

### Neural Network

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Scale the features using StandardScaler


scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create a Neural Network model
nn_model = MLPRegressor(random_state=42)

# Train the model
nn_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
nn_predictions = nn_model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the model
nn_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, nn_predictions)
nn_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, nn_predictions, squared=False)

print(f"Neural Network - Mean Absolute Error: {nn_mae}")
print(f"Neural Network - Root Mean Squared Error: {nn_rmse}")
```

In this code snippet, we import the `MLPRegressor` class from scikit-learn to create a Neural Network model. Before training the model, we use `StandardScaler` to scale the features in both the training and testing sets. Then, we train the Neural Network model and make predictions on the testing set. Finally, we calculate the MAE and RMSE to evaluate the model's performance.

## Step 3: Model Comparison and Selection

Now that we have evaluated the performance of each model, we can compare their results and select the most accurate model for predicting calorie intake.

```python
# Create a dictionary to store the model performances
model_performances = {
    'Linear Regression': linear_rmse,
    'Decision Tree': tree_rmse,
    'Neural Network': nn_rmse
}

# Find the model with the lowest RMSE
best_model = min(model_performances, key=model_performances.get)
best_rmse = model_performances[best_model]

print(f"The best model for calorie intake prediction is {best_model} with an RMSE of {best_rmse}.")
```

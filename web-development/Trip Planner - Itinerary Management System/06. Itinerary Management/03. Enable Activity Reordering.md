## Allowing Users to Reorder Activities within an Itinerary

In this guide, we will implement the functionality to allow users to reorder activities within an itinerary. This will provide users with the flexibility to arrange their activities in the desired order.

### Step 1: Identify the DOM Elements for Reordering

1. Identify the HTML element or elements that represent each activity in the itinerary.
2. Assign unique identifiers or class names to these elements to easily target them in JavaScript.
3. Determine the elements that will be used to trigger the reordering action (e.g., drag handles, up/down arrows).

    For example, if each activity is displayed as a `<li>` element with a class name of `activity`, and you have drag handles represented by `<span>` elements with a class name of `drag-handle`, you can select them using JavaScript as follows:
    
    ```javascript
    const activities = document.querySelectorAll('.activity');
    const dragHandles = document.querySelectorAll('.drag-handle');
    ```

### Step 2: Implement Drag and Drop Functionality

1. Add event listeners to the drag handles to capture user interactions.
2. Implement the necessary logic to handle the drag and drop actions, such as tracking the dragged item and its target position.
3. Update the order of activities based on the user's drag and drop action.
4. Update the user interface to reflect the new order of activities.
    
    Example:
    
    ```javascript
    // Track the dragged item
    let draggedItem = null;
    
    // Add event listeners to drag handles
    dragHandles.forEach((dragHandle) => {
      dragHandle.addEventListener('dragstart', (event) => {
        draggedItem = event.target.closest('.activity');
        draggedItem.classList.add('dragging');
      });
    
      dragHandle.addEventListener('dragover', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const dropZone = event.target.closest('.activity');
        if (dropZone && dropZone !== draggedItem) {
          dropZone.insertAdjacentElement('beforebegin', draggedItem);
        }
      });
    
      dragHandle.addEventListener('dragend', () => {
        draggedItem.classList.remove('dragging');
        draggedItem = null;
      });
    });
    ```
    
    In the above code, we add event listeners to the drag handles for the `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `dragend` events. During the `dragstart` event, we store the dragged item in the `draggedItem` variable and add a CSS class to visually indicate dragging. The `dragover` event is used to handle the drop zone and update the order of activities by inserting the dragged item before the drop zone. Finally, during the `dragend` event, we remove the CSS class and reset the `draggedItem` variable.

### Step 3: Test the Functionality

1. Save your JavaScript file.
2. Interact with the user interface by dragging and dropping activities to different positions within the itinerary.
3. Verify that the activity order updates correctly and is reflected in the user interface.

### Step 4: Styling and Formatting (Optional)

1. Apply appropriate CSS styles to the dragged item and drop zone to provide visual feedback during the drag and drop operation.
2. Customize the appearance of the drag handles or add animations to enhance the user experience.

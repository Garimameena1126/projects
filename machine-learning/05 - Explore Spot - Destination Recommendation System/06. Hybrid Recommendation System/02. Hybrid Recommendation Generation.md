### Step 1: Load the Collaborative Filtering Recommendations
First, we need to obtain the recommendations generated by the collaborative filtering approach. These recommendations are based on user preferences and similarities to other users.

```python
# Load collaborative filtering recommendations
collab_recommendations = load_collaborative_filtering_recommendations()
```

### Step 2: Load the Content-Based Filtering Recommendations
Next, we load the recommendations generated by the content-based filtering approach. These recommendations are based on the similarity of destination attributes to the user's preferences.

```python
# Load content-based filtering recommendations
content_recommendations = load_content_based_filtering_recommendations()
```

### Step 3: Define Weights for Collaborative and Content-Based Recommendations
To balance the contributions of each method, we assign weights to the collaborative filtering and content-based filtering recommendations. These weights determine the relative importance of each approach in generating the final recommendations.

```python
collab_weight = 0.5  # Weight for collaborative filtering recommendations
content_weight = 0.5  # Weight for content-based filtering recommendations
```

### Step 4: Combine the Recommendations
Now, we combine the collaborative filtering and content-based filtering recommendations using the weights defined in the previous step. One way to combine the recommendations is by taking a weighted average of the scores assigned to each destination.

```python
final_recommendations = {}

# Iterate over collaborative filtering recommendations
for destination, score in collab_recommendations.items():
    if destination in final_recommendations:
        final_recommendations[destination] += collab_weight * score
    else:
        final_recommendations[destination] = collab_weight * score

# Iterate over content-based filtering recommendations
for destination, score in content_recommendations.items():
    if destination in final_recommendations:
        final_recommendations[destination] += content_weight * score
    else:
        final_recommendations[destination] = content_weight * score
```

### Step 5: Sort and Return the Final Recommendations
Finally, we sort the combined recommendations based on the calculated scores and return the final recommendations to the user.

```python
final_recommendations = dict(sorted(final_recommendations.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True))

return final_recommendations
```

In this guide, we will implement real-time notifications using either WebSockets or server-sent events. Real-time notifications allow users to receive updates instantly without having to manually refresh the page.

### Step 1: Choose a Real-Time Communication Technology

1. Decide whether you want to use WebSockets or server-sent events for implementing real-time notifications.
2. WebSockets provide full-duplex communication channels between the client and the server, enabling real-time bidirectional communication.
3. Server-sent events allow the server to push updates to the client using a unidirectional channel.

### Step 2: Set Up the Server-Side

1. Install the necessary dependencies for the chosen real-time communication technology. For example, if using WebSockets, you might need to install the `socket.io` library.
2. Set up the server-side code to handle real-time communication. This involves creating an endpoint or route that will listen for incoming connections or events.
3. Configure the server to handle the necessary events or actions that trigger real-time notifications. For example, when a new task is assigned or a deadline is updated, you may want to broadcast that information to connected clients.

Example (using Node.js and the `socket.io` library for WebSockets):
```markdown
```javascript
// Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn
npm install socket.io

// Import the necessary modules and set up the server
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer();
const io = require('socket.io')(server);

// Listen for incoming connections
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('A client has connected');

  // Handle the necessary events or actions
  socket.on('taskAssigned', (data) => {
    // Broadcast the task assignment event to all connected clients
    io.emit('newTaskAssigned', data);
  });

  // Handle other events or actions as needed
});

// Start the server
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Client-Side

1. Include the necessary JavaScript libraries or frameworks for the chosen real-time communication technology. For example, if using WebSockets, you might need to include the `socket.io` client library.
2. Set up the client-side code to establish a connection with the server and listen for real-time events or updates.
3. Implement the necessary logic to handle the received events or updates and display the notifications to the user.

Example (using JavaScript and the `socket.io` client library for WebSockets):
```markdown
```html
<!-- Include the necessary JavaScript library -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/4.3.1/socket.io.js"></script>

<!-- Set up the client-side code -->
<script>
  // Connect to the server
  const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

  // Listen for real-time events
  socket.on('newTaskAssigned', (data) => {
    // Handle the received event and display the notification to the user
    displayNotification(data.taskName);
  });

  // Implement other event listeners as needed

  // Display the notification to the user
  function displayNotification(taskName) {
    // Implement the logic to display the notification on the user interface
  }
</script>
```

### Step 4: Trigger Real-Time Notifications

1. Identify the events or actions in your application that should trigger real-time

 notifications.
2. When those events or actions occur, emit the corresponding event from the server to notify the connected clients.
3. The connected clients will receive the event and update the user interface accordingly.

Example (emitting a `taskAssigned` event when a new task is assigned):
```markdown
```javascript
// Emit the taskAssigned event from the server when a new task is assigned
socket.emit('taskAssigned', { taskName: 'New Task' });
```

Collaborative filtering is a technique commonly used in recommendation systems to provide personalized recommendations based on the similarities between users. In this task, we'll implement a collaborative filtering approach to generate recommendations based on user preferences and similarities to other users. We'll explore both user-based collaborative filtering and item-based collaborative filtering methods.

### Step 1: Load and Prepare the Dataset

1. Start by loading the dataset that contains information about users, items, and their ratings or preferences. The dataset should have a structure where each row represents a user-item pair with its corresponding rating.
2. Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, if any. You can choose to either remove rows with missing values or fill them with appropriate values based on the context.
3. Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to build the collaborative filtering model, and the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

### Step 2: Implement User-Based Collaborative Filtering

1. Calculate the similarity between users based on their ratings. One common similarity measure is the cosine similarity, which quantifies the similarity between two vectors. You can use the formula:

```
similarity(user1, user2) = cosine(user1_ratings, user2_ratings)
```

2. For each user in the dataset, find the k most similar users based on their ratings. This can be done by calculating the similarity scores between the target user and all other users, and then selecting the top k users with the highest similarity scores.
3. Once you have identified the k most similar users for each target user, use their ratings to generate recommendations. One simple approach is to calculate the weighted average of the ratings given by similar users to items that the target user has not rated. The weights can be determined by the similarity scores.
4. Implement the above steps in code, taking care to handle any edge cases or exceptions that may arise.

### Step 3: Implement Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

1. Calculate the similarity between items based on the ratings given by users. Again, you can use the cosine similarity measure to quantify the similarity between two items.
2. For each user in the dataset, identify the items they have rated and find the k most similar items to each of those items. This step is similar to finding similar users in the user-based approach but applied to items instead.
3. Once you have identified the k most similar items for each item rated by a user, use their ratings to generate recommendations. One common approach is to calculate the weighted average of the ratings given to similar items by the user, where the weights are determined by the similarity scores.
4. Implement the above steps in code, ensuring that you handle any potential exceptions or corner cases.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Collaborative Filtering Model

1. Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, or mean average precision to assess the performance of the collaborative filtering model.
2. Calculate the recommendations for the test set users using both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering methods.
3. Compare the generated recommendations against the actual ratings in the test set to measure the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.
4. Implement the evaluation process and compute the evaluation metrics in your code.

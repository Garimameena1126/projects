# Track Social Media Shares and Generate Reports

In this guide, we will focus on tracking social media shares and generating reports on the number of shares for the travel packages on your website. By implementing tracking functionality and generating reports, you can gather valuable insights into the reach and engagement of your shared content. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Select a Tracking Platform

To track social media shares, we need to select a tracking platform that provides the necessary analytics and reporting capabilities. One popular choice is Google Analytics. If you haven't set up Google Analytics for your website, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your Google Analytics account or create a new account at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com).
2. Set up a new property for your website by clicking on the "Admin" tab and selecting "Create Property" under the "Property" column.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure your property and obtain the tracking code.

## Step 2: Implement Event Tracking

To track social media shares, we will use event tracking. Event tracking allows you to monitor specific user interactions on your website, such as social media shares. We will focus on tracking shares using JavaScript.

Add the following code snippet to your travel package page where you have the social media sharing buttons:

```html
<button id="facebook-share">Share on Facebook</button>
<button id="twitter-share">Share on Twitter</button>

<script>
// Track Facebook share
document.getElementById("facebook-share").addEventListener("click", function() {
  ga("send", "event", "Social Media", "Share", "Facebook");
});

// Track Twitter share
document.getElementById("twitter-share").addEventListener("click", function() {
  ga("send", "event", "Social Media", "Share", "Twitter");
});
</script>
```

In the code snippet above, replace `"facebook-share"` and `"twitter-share"` with the actual IDs or classes of your social media sharing buttons.

## Step 3: Generate Reports in Google Analytics

Once you have implemented event tracking for social media shares, you can generate reports in Google Analytics to view the number of shares.

1. Sign in to your Google Analytics account.
2. Select the property corresponding to your website.
3. Navigate to the "Behavior" section in the left sidebar and click on "Events" -> "Overview".
4. You should see a list of event categories. Click on "Social Media" to view the social media share events.
5. In the event report, you can analyze the number of shares, engagement metrics, and other relevant data.

## Step 4: Additional Reporting and Analysis

Google Analytics provides a range of reporting and analysis features that can help you gain deeper insights into social media shares. You can explore the following options:

- Create custom reports to visualize and analyze specific metrics related to social media shares.
- Set up goals to track conversions and actions taken after social media shares.
- Utilize segmentation to compare the performance of different travel packages or user segments.
- Set up automated reports to receive regular updates on social media share metrics.

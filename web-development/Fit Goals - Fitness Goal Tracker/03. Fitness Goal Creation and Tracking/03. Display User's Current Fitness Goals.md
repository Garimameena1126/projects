# Displaying User's Current Fitness Goals on the Dashboard

In this task, we will focus on displaying the user's current fitness goals on their dashboard. This will allow them to have a quick overview of their goals and track their progress. We'll assume that you have already set up the necessary project structure and have a functional dashboard page in place. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Fetching the User's Fitness Goals from the Database

To display the user's fitness goals on the dashboard, we first need to retrieve the goals from the database. In this guide, we'll assume you're using Node.js with MongoDB as the database.

1. Import the necessary dependencies and set up a connection to the MongoDB database.

   ```javascript
   // Import required modules
   const express = require('express');
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   // Connect to MongoDB
   mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/fitness_goal_tracker', {
     useNewUrlParser: true,
     useUnifiedTopology: true,
   });
   ```

2. Define a schema for the fitness goals in a separate file (e.g., `Goal.js`).

   ```javascript
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const goalSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     type: String,
     metrics: {
       weight: Number,
       reps: Number,
       distance: Number,
     },
     userId: {
       type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
       ref: 'User',
     },
   });

   module.exports = mongoose.model('Goal', goalSchema);
   ```

3. Create an endpoint to fetch the user's goals based on their user ID. Add the following code to your server file (e.g., `server.js`).

   ```javascript
   const Goal = require('./models/Goal');

   app.get('/goals', (req, res) => {
     const userId = req.query.userId; // Assuming the user ID is passed as a query parameter

     Goal.find({ userId }, (err, goals) => {
       if (err) {
         console.error(err);
         return res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred' });
       }

       return res.json(goals);
     });
   });
   ```

## Step 2: Displaying the Goals on the Dashboard

Now that we have the user's fitness goals from the database, let's proceed to display them on the dashboard page.

1. In your frontend code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), create a container element to hold the goals on the dashboard. You can use HTML and CSS to style this container according to your project's design.

   ```html
   <div id="goals-container"></div>
   ```

2. In your JavaScript file (or a separate script), make an AJAX request to the server to fetch the user's goals.

   ```javascript
   const goalsContainer = document.getElementById('goals-container');

   // Function to fetch goals and render them on the dashboard
   function fetchAndRenderGoals(userId) {
     fetch(`/goals?userId=${userId}`)
       .then((response) => response.json())
       .then((goals) => {
         // Call a function to render the goals on the dashboard
         renderGoals(goals);
       })
       .catch((error) => {
         console.error(error);
       });
   }
   ```

3. Write a function to render the goals on the dashboard. You can use DOM manipulation methods like `createElement` and `appendChild` to dynamically create and append the goal elements to the container.

   ```javascript
   function renderGoals(goals) {
     // Clear the existing goals container
     goalsContainer.innerHTML = '';

     // Loop through the goals and create elements to display each goal
     goals.forEach((goal) =>{
       const goalElement = document.createElement('div');
       goalElement.classList.add('goal'); // Apply appropriate CSS classes

       // Build the content of the goal element based on the goal data
       const goalContent = `
         <h3>${goal.type}</h3>
         <p>Weight: ${goal.metrics.weight}</p>
         <p>Reps: ${goal.metrics.reps}</p>
         <p>Distance: ${goal.metrics.distance}</p>
       `;

       // Set the content of the goal element
       goalElement.innerHTML = goalContent;

       // Append the goal element to the goals container
       goalsContainer.appendChild(goalElement);
     });}
   ```

4. Finally, call the `fetchAndRenderGoals` function when the dashboard page loads, passing the user ID of the logged-in user.

   ```javascript
   // Get the logged-in user ID from your authentication system
   const loggedInUserId = getUserId();

   // Fetch and render the goals on the dashboard
   fetchAndRenderGoals(loggedInUserId);
   ```

That's it! After implementing the above steps, the user's fitness goals will be fetched from the database and displayed on the dashboard page. Make sure to customize the HTML and CSS as per your project's requirements and design.

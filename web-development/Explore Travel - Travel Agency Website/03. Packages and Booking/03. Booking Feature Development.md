#  Implementing a Booking Feature

In this guide, we will implement a booking feature that allows users to select a package and provide their contact details. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Set Up the Booking Form

1. Open the `packages.html` file in your code editor.

2. Locate the `<section id="packages">` section.

3. Add a new `<form>` element inside the section to hold the booking form.

    ```html
    <section id="packages">
      <!-- Existing package cards -->
    
      <form id="booking-form">
        <!-- Booking form elements will be added here -->
      </form>
    </section>
    ```

4. Inside the `<form>` element, add the necessary input fields and a submit button for the booking form. You can include fields like name, email, package selection, and a submit button.

    ```html
    <section id="packages">
      <!-- Existing package cards -->
    
      <form id="booking-form">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" required>
    
        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" required>
    
        <label for="package">Select a Package:</label>
        <select id="package" required>
          <!-- Add options for package selection -->
        </select>
    
        <button type="submit">Book Now</button>
      </form>
    </section>
    ```

## Step 2: Write JavaScript Code to Handle Form Submission

1. Open the `script.js` file in your code editor.

2. Add the following JavaScript code to handle the form submission and display an alert with the user's input.

    ```javascript
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
      const bookingForm = document.getElementById('booking-form');
    
      bookingForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
        event.preventDefault();
    
        const nameInput = document.getElementById('name');
        const emailInput = document.getElementById('email');
        const packageInput = document.getElementById('package');
    
        const formData = {
          name: nameInput.value,
          email: emailInput.value,
          package: packageInput.value
        };
    
        // Replace the alert with your own logic to process the form data
        alert('Booking submitted!\n\n' + JSON.stringify(formData));
      });
    });
    ```

The JavaScript code above performs the following steps:
- Listens for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the HTML content has loaded before executing the JavaScript code.
- Retrieves the booking form element from the DOM.
- Adds an event listener to the booking form's submit event.
- Prevents the default form submission behavior.
- Retrieves the values entered by the user in the form fields.
- Creates a JavaScript object (`formData`) with the form input values.
- Displays an alert with the form data. Replace the alert with your own logic to process the form data.

## Step 3: Link the JavaScript File to the Packages Page

1. Open the `packages.html` file in your code editor.

2. Insert the following `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag to link the `script.js` file:
    
    ```html
    <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
    ```

Replace `"path/to/script.js"` with the actual path to your `script.js` file.

## Step 4: Test the Booking Feature

1. Save the changes made to the `packages.html` and `script.js` files.

2. Open the `packages.html` file in your web browser.

3. Fill in the booking form with sample data (name, email, package selection).

4. Click the "Book Now" button to submit the form.

5. Observe the alert displaying the form data.

 You can replace the alert with your own logic to process the form data, such as sending it to a server or storing it in a database.

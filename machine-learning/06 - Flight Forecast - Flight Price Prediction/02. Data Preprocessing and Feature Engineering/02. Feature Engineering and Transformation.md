# Module 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

## Task: Perform Feature Engineering for Flight Price Prediction

In this task, we will focus on feature engineering for our flight price prediction model. Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of our model. We will explore examples of feature engineering techniques that might be relevant for predicting flight prices, such as incorporating the day of the week and time of day as features.

Let's get started with the step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Load the Dataset

The first step is to load the preprocessed dataset that we obtained from the data collection and exploration module. Make sure you have the dataset file available.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the preprocessed dataset
df = pd.read_csv('flight_data.csv')
```

### Step 2: Explore the Dataset

Before performing feature engineering, let's take a quick look at the dataset to understand its structure and variables.

```python
# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())

# Check the data types of each column
print(df.dtypes)

# Get summary statistics of numerical columns
print(df.describe())

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

### Step 3: Create New Features

Now, let's create new features that might be relevant for predicting flight prices. In this example, we will create two new features: "day_of_week" and "time_of_day".

#### Example: Creating the "day_of_week" Feature

We can extract the day of the week from the date column and represent it as a categorical feature.

```python
# Convert the date column to datetime format
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# Extract the day of the week and map it to categorical values
df['day_of_week'] = df['date'].dt.day_name()
df['day_of_week'] = df['day_of_week'].map({
    'Monday': 'weekday',
    'Tuesday': 'weekday',
    'Wednesday': 'weekday',
    'Thursday': 'weekday',
    'Friday': 'weekday',
    'Saturday': 'weekend',
    'Sunday': 'weekend'
})
```

#### Example: Creating the "time_of_day" Feature

We can extract the time of the day from the departure time column and represent it as a categorical feature.

```python
# Extract the hour from the departure time
df['departure_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['departure_time'])
df['hour_of_day'] = df['departure_time'].dt.hour

# Map the hour of the day to categorical values
df['time_of_day'] = df['hour_of_day'].apply(lambda x: 'morning' if 6 <= x < 12 else
                                                  'afternoon' if 12 <= x < 18 else
                                                  'evening')
```

### Step 4: Transform Existing Features

In addition to creating new features, we can also transform existing features to improve their usefulness in predicting flight prices. Let's consider an example where we transform the "duration" feature to represent the flight duration in minutes.

#### Example: Transforming the "duration" Feature

Assuming the "duration" feature is initially represented in hours and minutes (e.g., "2h 30m"), we can convert it to minutes for easier interpretation.

```python
# Extract hours and minutes from the duration column
df['hours'] = df['duration'].str.extract('(\d+)h').astype(float)
df['minutes'] = df['duration'].str.extract('(\d+)m').astype(float)

# Convert hours to minutes and add it to the minutes column
df['duration_minutes'] = df['

hours'] * 60 + df['minutes']
```

### Step 5: Encode Categorical Variables

Machine learning models typically require numerical inputs, so we need to encode categorical variables into numerical representations. One common approach is one-hot encoding.

```python
# Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables
encoded_df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['day_of_week', 'time_of_day', 'airline', 'departure_airport', 'arrival_airport'])
```

### Step 6: Perform Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is important to ensure that features with different scales do not introduce bias into the model. Common scaling techniques include min-max scaling and standardization.

#### Example: Min-Max Scaling

Min-max scaling scales the features to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1).

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Initialize the scaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()

# Scale the numerical features
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(encoded_df[['duration_minutes', 'distance']])

# Create a new DataFrame with the scaled features
scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(scaled_features, columns=['duration_minutes', 'distance'])

# Combine the scaled features with the encoded categorical variables
final_df = pd.concat([scaled_df, encoded_df.drop(['duration_minutes', 'distance'], axis=1)], axis=1)
```

### Step 7: Finalize the Preprocessed Dataset

After performing feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features, we have our preprocessed dataset ready for model training and evaluation.

```python
# Display the final preprocessed dataset
print(final_df.head())

# Save the preprocessed dataset for future use
final_df.to_csv('preprocessed_flight_data.csv', index=False)
```

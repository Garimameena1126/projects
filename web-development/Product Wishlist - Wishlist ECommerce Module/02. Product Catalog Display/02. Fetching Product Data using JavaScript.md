1. Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Make sure you have created the JSON file to store the product data, as explained in the previous guide.

3. Open the HTML file where you want to display the product data. It could be the landing page or any other relevant page.

4. Add a `<script>` tag within the `<head>` section of your HTML file to include your JavaScript code.

5. Inside the `<script>` tag, create a function that will handle the product data fetching. For example, you can name it `fetchProductData()`.

6. Within the `fetchProductData()` function, use the `fetch()` function to fetch the product data from the JSON file. Pass the path to the `products.json` file as the argument to the `fetch()` function.

   ```javascript
   function fetchProductData() {
     fetch('products.json')
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(data => {
         // Handle the fetched data here
       })
       .catch(error => {
         console.error('Error fetching product data:', error);
       });
   }
   ```

   The `fetch()` function returns a promise that resolves to the `Response` object. We use the `response.json()` method to parse the response as JSON.

7. Inside the second `.then()` method, you can access the fetched product data through the `data` variable. You can perform various operations with this data, such as generating product cards dynamically or updating the UI.

   ```javascript
   function fetchProductData() {
     fetch('products.json')
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(data => {
         // Access the fetched product data
         console.log(data);
         // Generate product cards or update the UI
       })
       .catch(error => {
         console.error('Error fetching product data:', error);
       });
   }
   ```

   In this example, the fetched product data is logged to the console. You can replace the `console.log(data)` statement with your desired logic to handle the data.

8. To trigger the fetching of product data, you can call the `fetchProductData()` function when the page loads. You can add an event listener for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the function is called after the page has finished loading.

   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fetchProductData);
   ```

   This code attaches an event listener to the `document` object that listens for the `DOMContentLoaded` event and calls the `fetchProductData()` function when the event is triggered.

9. Save your HTML file.

# Implement Client-Side Validation for the Exercise Form

In this task, we will focus on implementing client-side validation for the exercise form. Client-side validation helps ensure that the user enters valid data before submitting the form to the server. By validating the data on the client side, we can provide immediate feedback to the user and prevent unnecessary server requests.

## Step 1: Add Validation Rules to the Exercise Form

To begin, we need to define the validation rules for each input field in the exercise form. These rules specify the criteria that the user's input must meet. Here's an example of adding validation rules for a few fields:

1. Open the HTML file where you have defined the exercise form. In this example, let's assume it's called `exercise.html`.

2. Find the input fields that you want to validate, such as `exerciseName`, `duration`, and `calories`.

3. Add the `required` attribute to make the fields mandatory. For example:

   ```html
   <input type="text" id="exerciseName" name="exerciseName" required>
   <input type="number" id="duration" name="duration" required>
   <input type="number" id="calories" name="calories" required>
   ```

4. Additionally, you can specify additional attributes to enforce specific validation rules. For example, to set a minimum value for the duration field, you can use the `min` attribute:

   ```html
   <input type="number" id="duration" name="duration" required min="1">
   ```

   This ensures that the value entered by the user is at least 1.

5. Repeat this process for any other input fields that require validation.

## Step 2: Implement Custom Validation Logic

In some cases, the built-in validation attributes might not be sufficient for your requirements. In such cases, you can implement custom validation logic using JavaScript. Here's an example of how to validate the exercise form using JavaScript:

1. Open the JavaScript file associated with your exercise form. Let's assume it's called `exercise.js`.

2. Inside the JavaScript file, define a function that will be triggered when the form is submitted:

   ```javascript
   document.getElementById("exerciseForm").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
       // Prevent the form from being submitted by default
       event.preventDefault();
   
       // Call the validation function
       validateExerciseForm();
   });
   ```

   In this example, we assume that the exercise form has an id attribute set to `exerciseForm`.

3. Implement the `validateExerciseForm` function to perform custom validation:

   ```javascript
   function validateExerciseForm() {
       // Get form inputs
       var exerciseName = document.getElementById("exerciseName").value;
       var duration = document.getElementById("duration").value;
       var calories = document.getElementById("calories").value;
   
       // Perform validation logic
       if (exerciseName === "") {
           alert("Exercise name is required.");
           return;
       }
   
       if (duration <= 0) {
           alert("Duration must be a positive number.");
           return;
       }
   
       if (calories <= 0) {
           alert("Calories burned must be a positive number.");
           return;
       }
   
       // If all validations pass, submit the form
       document.getElementById("exerciseForm").submit();
   }
   ```

   This function retrieves the values entered by the user and performs custom validation checks. If any validation fails, an alert message is displayed to the user. Otherwise, the form is submitted.

4. Save the JavaScript file.

## Step 3: Test the Client-Side Validation

To ensure that the client-side validation is working as expected,

 you can test it by following these steps:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.

2. Enter some data into the exercise form, making sure to meet or violate the validation rules you defined.

3. Submit the form by clicking the submit button or pressing Enter.

4. Verify that the validation error messages are displayed for any invalid fields.

5. Correct the validation errors and try submitting the form again to ensure it submits successfully when all validations pass.

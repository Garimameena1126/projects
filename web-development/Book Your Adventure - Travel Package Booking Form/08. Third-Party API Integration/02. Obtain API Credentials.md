In this task, we will obtain the necessary API credentials from the selected travel API provider. Follow the steps below to accomplish this.

1. Visit the Provider's Website
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the website of the selected travel API provider.
   - Look for a section or page that provides information about accessing the API and obtaining credentials.

2. Create an Account
   - If you don't already have an account with the provider, locate the registration or sign-up option on their website.
   - Fill in the required information and follow the registration process to create a new account.

3. Explore API Documentation
   - Once you have an account, navigate to the documentation section of the provider's website.
   - Look for documentation related to API access and authentication.
   - Read the documentation carefully to understand the process of obtaining API credentials.

4. Identify the Authentication Method
   - Determine the authentication method supported by the API provider. Common authentication methods include API keys, access tokens, or OAuth.
   - Pay attention to any specific instructions or guidelines provided by the provider regarding the authentication process.

5. Generate API Credentials
   - Depending on the authentication method, follow the instructions provided by the provider to generate the required credentials.
   - If using API keys, look for a section in your account settings or developer dashboard where you can create a new API key.
   - If using access tokens or OAuth, follow the instructions to generate the necessary tokens or set up the OAuth flow.

6. Store the Credentials Securely
   - Once you have obtained the API credentials, it's important to store them securely.
   - Consider using environment variables or a dedicated configuration file to store the credentials outside of your source code.
   - Avoid hard-coding the credentials directly into your code, as this can pose security risks.

7. Test the Credentials
   - Before proceeding with the integration, test the obtained credentials to ensure they are valid and working.
   - Refer to the provider's documentation to find sample API requests or test endpoints that can be used to verify the credentials.
   - Make a test request using the credentials and check if you receive the expected response.

1. **Choose a client-side technology**: Determine which client-side technology you will use to establish the connection and receive updates. WebSocket and server-sent events are supported in different programming languages and frameworks. Choose the one that best aligns with your project's requirements and familiarity.

2. **Create a client file**: Create a new file or modify an existing client file to handle the connection and updates. This file will serve as your client-side implementation.

3. **Include the necessary dependencies**: If you're using a framework or library, include the required dependencies in your HTML file or import them in your client-side code. This step may vary depending on the technology you choose. Refer to the official documentation or community resources for guidance on including the necessary packages.

4. **Establish the connection**: Use the client-side technology's API or library to establish a connection between the client and server. This step will differ depending on whether you're using WebSocket or server-sent events.

   - For WebSocket:
     - Create a new WebSocket object and provide the server's URL as an argument.
     - Attach event listeners to handle the connection and updates.

     ```javascript
     const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

     socket.addEventListener('open', () => {
       // Connection established
     });

     socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
       // Handle received message from the server
       const data = event.data;
       // Update the UI based on the received data
     });

     socket.addEventListener('close', () => {
       // Connection closed
     });
     ```

   - For server-sent events:
     - Create an EventSource object and provide the server's URL as an argument.
     - Attach event listeners to handle the connection and updates.

     ```javascript
     const eventSource = new EventSource('/updates');

     eventSource.addEventListener('open', () => {
       // Connection established
     });

     eventSource.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
       // Handle received message from the server
       const data = event.data;
       // Update the UI based on the received data
     });

     eventSource.addEventListener('error', () => {
       // Connection error or closed
     });
     ```

   Customize the URLs and event handlers based on your server-side implementation.

5. **Test the connection**: Save your client file and open your application in a web browser. Check the browser's developer console for any errors related to the connection. Ensure that the connection is established successfully.

6. **Receive and process updates**: When updates are emitted from the server, the client-side event handlers will be triggered. Update your client-side code to handle these events and update the UI accordingly. Use the received data to update the relevant components or elements of your application.

   ```javascript
   socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
     const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

     // Update the UI based on the received data
     // Example: Update a list of available time slots
     const timeSlotsContainer = document.getElementById('time-slots');

     // Clear the existing content
     timeSlotsContainer.innerHTML = '';

     // Iterate over the received time slots and create list items
     data.timeSlots.forEach((timeSlot) => {
       const listItem = document.createElement('li');
       listItem.textContent = timeSlot;
       timeSlotsContainer.appendChild(listItem);
     });
   });
   ```

   Customize the data processing logic and UI updates based on your application's requirements.

7. **

Handle errors and disconnections**: Implement error handling and disconnection scenarios to ensure a robust client-server communication. Update the event handlers to handle potential errors or disconnections gracefully. Provide appropriate feedback to the user when errors occur or the connection is lost.

   ```javascript
   socket.addEventListener('error', (error) => {
     console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
     // Display an error message to the user
   });

   socket.addEventListener('close', () => {
     console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
     // Display a message or prompt the user to reconnect
   });
   ```

   Adjust the error handling code based on your application's error reporting and recovery strategy.

8. **Test the real-time updates**: Ensure that your client-side implementation is correctly receiving updates from the server in real-time. Make changes on the server-side that trigger updates and observe the changes being reflected in the client's UI without requiring a page refresh.

   For example, if a new time slot becomes available or an existing time slot is removed, the UI should update immediately based on the received updates.

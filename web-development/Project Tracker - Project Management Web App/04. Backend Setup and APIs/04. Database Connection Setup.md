# Connect the Backend to a Database

In this task, we will set up a connection between the backend of our project management application and a database. We have the flexibility to choose between databases like MongoDB or MySQL based on our preference. For the purpose of this guide, we will demonstrate the steps using MongoDB as the database.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Node.js installed on your machine.
2. MongoDB installed and running locally or access to a MongoDB database server.
3. Express framework installed in your project.

## Step 1: Install MongoDB Driver for Node.js
To connect our Node.js application with MongoDB, we need to install the MongoDB driver. Open your project folder in the terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
npm install mongodb
```

## Step 2: Import the MongoDB module
In your Express application, you need to import the MongoDB module. Open the file where you initialize your backend server (usually `app.js` or `index.js`) and add the following code at the top:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
```

## Step 3: Define the MongoDB connection URL
Next, we need to define the connection URL for MongoDB. The URL typically follows the format: `mongodb://<host>:<port>/<database-name>`. Modify the connection URL according to your MongoDB server configuration and add the following code after the import statement:

```javascript
const mongoURL = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/project-management';
```

Make sure to replace `localhost:27017` with the actual host and port of your MongoDB server. `project-management` should be replaced with the name you want to give to your database.

## Step 4: Connect to the MongoDB database
We will create a reusable function that establishes the connection to the MongoDB database. Add the following code after the connection URL declaration:

```javascript
async function connectToDatabase() {
  try {
    const client = await MongoClient.connect(mongoURL, { useUnifiedTopology: true });
    return client.db();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to connect to the database:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Call the connectToDatabase function
const db = await connectToDatabase();
```

The `connectToDatabase` function establishes a connection to the MongoDB server and returns the database object.

## Step 5: Use the database object in your API endpoints
Now that we have the database connection, we can use the `db` object to perform database operations in our API endpoints. For example, let's consider an API endpoint to retrieve existing projects. In your Express route handler file (e.g., `routes/projects.js`), add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/projects', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const projects = await db.collection('projects').find().toArray();
    res.json(projects);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to retrieve projects:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve projects' });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

In this example, we retrieve all the projects from the `projects` collection in the MongoDB database and send the result as JSON response.

## Step 6: Implement API endpoints for adding new projects and tasks
Similarly, you can create API endpoints to add new projects and tasks to the database. For instance, in the `routes/projects.js` file, add the following code:

```javascript
router.post('/projects', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const project = req.body; // Assuming the project data

 is sent in the request body
    const result = await db.collection('projects').insertOne(project);
    res.json(result.ops[0]);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to add project:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to add project' });
  }
});
```

This code handles a `POST` request to the `/projects` endpoint, where we assume the project data is sent in the request body. We insert the project into the `projects` collection and return the newly created project as the JSON response.

Similarly, you can create API endpoints for adding tasks by creating an appropriate route handler in a separate file (e.g., `routes/tasks.js`).

## Step 7: Test the API endpoints using Postman
To ensure that our API endpoints are functioning correctly, we can test them using a tool like Postman. Start your Express server and use Postman to send requests to the relevant endpoints (`/projects` and `/tasks`).

For example, to add a new project, send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:3000/projects` with the project data in the request body. Verify that the project is successfully added to the MongoDB database.

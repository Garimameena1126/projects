# Beginner's Guide: Installing Development Tools

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing the necessary development tools for your web development project. These tools include an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), a text editor, and a command line interface (CLI). By following these steps, you will be able to set up your development environment and begin working on your project.

## Step 1: Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An IDE provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development. It typically includes features such as code editing, debugging, and project management. For this project, we recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular and user-friendly IDE.

Follow the instructions below to install Visual Studio Code:

1. Visit the official website for Visual Studio Code at [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).
2. Click on the "Download" button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Once the installer file is downloaded, run it and follow the installation wizard.
4. Accept the license agreement and choose the desired installation location.
5. Select additional components if needed (such as adding VS Code to the system PATH).
6. Complete the installation process by following the on-screen instructions.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Visual Studio Code, the IDE for your web development project.

## Step 2: Choose a Text Editor

While an IDE offers a wide range of features, some developers prefer a lightweight and customizable text editor for their coding needs. In this step, we will install a popular text editor called Sublime Text.

Follow the instructions below to install Sublime Text:

1. Go to the official website for Sublime Text at [https://www.sublimetext.com](https://www.sublimetext.com).
2. Click on the "Download" button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Once the installer file is downloaded, run it and follow the installation wizard.
4. Accept the license agreement and choose the desired installation location.
5. Select additional components if needed (such as adding Sublime Text to the system PATH).
6. Complete the installation process by following the on-screen instructions.

Great! You now have Sublime Text installed, which you can use as a lightweight text editor for your project.

## Step 3: Set Up a Command Line Interface (CLI)

A Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to interact with your computer and execute commands. It is an essential tool for running scripts, managing dependencies, and performing various tasks related to web development. For this project, we will use the command line interface provided by Git Bash, which also includes Git version control.

Follow the instructions below to install Git Bash:

1. Visit the official website for Git at [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).
2. Click on the "Download" button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Once the installer file is downloaded, run it and follow the installation wizard.
4. Accept the license agreement and choose the desired installation location.
5. Select additional components if needed (such as configuring the line ending conversions and terminal emulator).
6. Choose the default editor for Git (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
7. Select the desired Git Credential Manager (Git Credential Manager Core is recommended).
8. Choose the appropriate option for adjusting your system's PATH environment.
9. Configure the line ending conversions based on your preference.
10. Complete the installation process by following the on-screen instructions.

Fantastic! You have now installed Git Bash, which provides a command line interface and version control system for your web development project.

## Step 4: Verify the Installation

To ensure that the development tools are installed correctly, let's verify

 their installations.

1. Open Visual Studio Code by searching for it in your applications or using the desktop shortcut.
2. In Visual Studio Code, go to **File > Open Folder** and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
3. Create a new file called `index.html` in the project directory and add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

4. Save the file.

Next, we'll open the command line interface (Git Bash) and verify its installation:

1. Open Git Bash by searching for it in your applications or using the desktop shortcut.
2. Navigate to the project directory by using the `cd` command. For example, if your project is located on the desktop, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/my-project
```

3. Once you're in the project directory, run the following command to check the Git installation:

```bash
git --version
```

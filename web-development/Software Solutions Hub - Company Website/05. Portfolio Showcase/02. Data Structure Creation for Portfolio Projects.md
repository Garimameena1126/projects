# Creating a Data Structure for Portfolio Projects

In this task, we will focus on creating a data structure to store information about projects in the portfolio. This data structure will hold details such as the project's name, description, and image. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task:

## Step 1: Determine the Project Information

1. Decide on the information you want to store for each project in the portfolio. Common details include the project's name, description, and an image.
2. You can add additional properties as per your requirements, such as project tags, completion date, or a link to the project's webpage.

## Step 2: Create the Data Structure

1. Open your JavaScript file where you are managing the portfolio-related code.
2. Declare a variable to hold the portfolio data and initialize it as an empty array. For example:
    ```javascript
    let portfolioData = [];
    ```

## Step 3: Add Projects to the Data Structure

1. To add projects to the data structure, create objects for each project and populate them with the required information.
2. Push the project objects into the `portfolioData` array. Here's an example of adding two projects:
    ```javascript
    let portfolioData = [];
    
    const project1 = {
      name: 'Project 1',
      description: 'This is the description of Project 1.',
      image: 'project1.jpg'
    };
    
    const project2 = {
      name: 'Project 2',
      description: 'This is the description of Project 2.',
      image: 'project2.jpg'
    };
    
    portfolioData.push(project1, project2);
    ```

## Step 4: Expand the Data Structure (Optional)

1. If you need to add more projects to the portfolio, repeat Step 3 by creating additional project objects and pushing them into the `portfolioData` array.

## Step 5: Test the Data Structure

1. Save the changes to your JavaScript file.
2. Open your website in a web browser that supports the JavaScript code.
3. Open the browser's developer console (usually accessible through the browser's menu or by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element").
4. In the console, log the `portfolioData` variable to verify that the projects are correctly stored.
```javascript
console.log(portfolioData);
```
5. Inspect the console output and ensure that the project objects are displayed with the correct information.

1. Open your preferred command-line interface (CLI) or terminal.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your project. For example, if your project directory is named "TechEnabledTravelAgency," use the following command to navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/TechEnabledTravelAgency
   ```

3. Once you're inside the project directory, you can set up a local development server using Node.js and the Express framework. First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check your Node.js installation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

   If Node.js is not installed, please refer to the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) for installation instructions.

4. Once you have Node.js installed, you can proceed to set up the local development server. In the root directory of your project, initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

   This command creates a new `package.json` file, which will store your project's dependencies and other configuration details.

5. Install the Express framework by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

6. Create a new file named `server.js` in the `server` directory (if you don't have one, create it) of your project.

7. Open the `server.js` file in your code editor and add the following code to set up a basic Express server:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000; // Choose any port number you prefer

   // Define a route to handle the root URL
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, world!'); // You can customize the response here
   });

   // Start the server
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

   This code imports the Express framework, creates an instance of the Express application, defines a route to handle the root URL (`/`), and starts the server on the specified port.

8. Save the `server.js` file.

9. Open your command-line interface or terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project (if you're not already there), and run the following command to start the local development server:

   ```bash
   node server/server.js
   ```

   This command runs the `server.js` file using Node.js, which starts the local development server on the specified port (in this case, port 3000).

10. Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port number you specified). You should see the "Hello, world!" message or any other response you customized in the Express route.

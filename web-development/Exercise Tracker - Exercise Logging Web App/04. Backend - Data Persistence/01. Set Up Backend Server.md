# Step-by-Step Guide: Set Up a Backend Server Using Node.js with Express

In this task, we will set up a backend server using Node.js with the Express framework. The backend server will handle incoming requests from the frontend and provide the necessary functionality to store and retrieve exercise data. Follow the step-by-step guide below to complete this task.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed

## Steps

1. **Create a New Project Directory**

   Start by creating a new directory for your backend server project. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the desired location, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   mkdir exercise-tracker-backend
   ```

   This command will create a new directory named `exercise-tracker-backend` that will serve as the root directory for your backend server project.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change into the project directory by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cd exercise-tracker-backend
   ```

3. **Initialize a New Node.js Project**

   Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

   This command will create a `package.json` file that tracks your project's dependencies and configuration.

4. **Install Express**

   Install the Express framework by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

   This command will download and install the Express package and its dependencies in your project.

5. **Create an Entry Point File**

   Create a new file named `server.js` in the root directory of your project. This file will serve as the entry point for your backend server.

6. **Require Express and Create an Express App**

   Open the `server.js` file in your code editor and add the following code:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   ```

   In this code, we require the Express module and create an instance of the Express application using the `express()` function. We store the instance in the `app` variable.

7. **Define a Test Route**

   Add the following code to create a test route that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed:

   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, World!');
   });
   ```

   In this code, we define a `GET` route for the root URL (`'/'`). When this route is accessed, the server will send the response "Hello, World!" back to the client.

8. **Start the Server**

   Add the following code at the end of the `server.js` file to start the server:

   ```javascript
   const port = 3000;

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

   In this code, we define a `port` variable to specify the port on which the server will listen for incoming requests. We set it to `3000` in this example. Finally, we call the `listen()` method on the Express app, passing in the `port` variable and a callback function that logs a message to the console when the server starts.

9. **Save the File**

   Save the changes made to the `server.js` file.

10. **Start the Backend Server**

    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory (`exercise-tracker-backend`), and run the following command:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

    This command will start the backend server, and you should see the message "Server running on

 port 3000" logged in the terminal.

11. **Test the Backend Server**

    Open a web browser and enter `http://localhost:3000` in the address bar. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in the browser.

    This confirms that your backend server is successfully set up and running.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a backend server using Node.js with the Express framework. The server is now able to handle incoming requests and respond with the "Hello, World!" message. This forms the foundation for implementing the API endpoints and connecting the backend to the frontend in the next tasks.

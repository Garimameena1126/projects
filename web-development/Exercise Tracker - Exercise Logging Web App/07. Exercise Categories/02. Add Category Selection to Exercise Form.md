# Task: Add Category Selection to the Exercise Form

In this task, we will enhance the exercise form by adding a category selection feature. This will allow users to categorize their exercises while logging them. Let's proceed with the step-by-step guide to implement this feature.

## Step 1: Update the Exercise Form UI

1. Open the exercise form UI file in your preferred code editor.

2. Locate the section of the form where the user enters exercise details.

3. Add a new field or element to the form specifically for category selection. This can be a dropdown menu, a list of checkboxes, or any other appropriate UI component.

4. Assign a unique identifier or class name to the category selection field for easy access in JavaScript.

   Example code snippet (HTML):
   ```html
   <label for="category">Category:</label>
   <select id="category" name="category">
     <option value="1">Category 1</option>
     <option value="2">Category 2</option>
     <!-- Add more options as needed -->
   </select>
   ```

## Step 2: Capture Category Selection in JavaScript

1. Open the JavaScript file associated with the exercise form.

2. Locate the function responsible for capturing form data when the user submits the form.

3. Inside the submit function, retrieve the value selected by the user for the category field.

   Example code snippet (JavaScript):
   ```javascript
   function handleSubmit(event) {
     event.preventDefault();

     // Retrieve exercise data from form fields
     const exerciseName = document.getElementById('exerciseName').value;
     // ... retrieve other exercise fields as needed

     // Retrieve selected category
     const selectedCategory = document.getElementById('category').value;

     // Create an object with exercise data, including the selected category
     const exerciseData = {
       name: exerciseName,
       // ... other exercise fields
       category: selectedCategory,
     };

     // Pass exerciseData to the function for further processing (e.g., sending to backend)
     // ...
   }
   ```

## Step 3: Update Backend API and Database

1. If you haven't done so already, implement the necessary backend API endpoints for exercise creation or update.

2. Modify the API endpoint to accept and store the selected category along with other exercise data.

3. Update the exercise table or collection in your database to include a field for storing the category information associated with each exercise.

   Example code snippet (pseudo-code for backend API endpoint):
   ```python
   app.post('/exercises', (req, res) => {
     // Extract exercise data from request body
     const { name, duration, category } = req.body;

     // Store exercise data in the database, including the category
     const newExercise = Exercise.create({
       name,
       duration,
       category,
       // ... other exercise fields
     });

     // Return a response to the client
     res.status(201).json(newExercise);
   });
   ```

## Step 4: Test and Refine

1. Run your application and navigate to the exercise form page.

2. Verify that the category selection field is visible and functional.

3. Submit the form with exercise data, including a selected category.

4. Validate that the submitted exercise data is stored correctly in the database, including the category information.

5. Make any necessary refinements or adjustments based on testing and feedback.


## Displaying a List of Bookings with Search and Filter Options

1. **Retrieve Booking Data**: Fetch the booking data from the database or API. Use appropriate queries or API calls to retrieve all the bookings. Ensure that you have access to the necessary data for displaying the bookings.

2. **Design the Booking List Component**: Design a component to display the list of bookings. Consider using a table or a list-based layout to present the booking information in a structured format. Each booking should be represented as a row or an item within the component.

3. **Render Bookings**: Populate the booking list component with the retrieved booking data. Iterate over the booking data and dynamically generate the necessary HTML or UI components to display each booking. Include relevant details such as booking ID, customer name, date, and status.

   Example code snippet for rendering a booking list component:

   ```javascript
   // Client-side code (JavaScript)

   const bookings = retrieveBookingData(); // Retrieve bookings from the server

   // Iterate over the bookings and generate HTML for each booking
   const bookingListHTML = bookings.map((booking) => {
     return `
       <tr>
         <td>${booking.id}</td>
         <td>${booking.customerName}</td>
         <td>${booking.date}</td>
         <td>${booking.status}</td>
       </tr>
     `;
   }).join('');

   // Inject the HTML into the booking list component
   document.getElementById('booking-list').innerHTML = bookingListHTML;
   ```

4. **Implement Search Functionality**: Add search functionality to the booking list to allow users to search for specific bookings based on criteria such as customer name or booking ID. Capture the user input and filter the bookings accordingly.

   Example code snippet for implementing search functionality:

   ```javascript
   // Client-side code (JavaScript)

   const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');
   const searchButton = document.getElementById('search-button');

   searchButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
     const searchTerm = searchInput.value.toLowerCase();

     // Filter bookings based on the search term
     const filteredBookings = bookings.filter((booking) => {
       return (
         booking.customerName.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm) ||
         booking.id.toString().includes(searchTerm)
       );
     });

     // Render the filtered bookings
     renderBookings(filteredBookings);
   });
   ```

5. **Implement Filter Options**: Provide additional filter options to allow users to refine the displayed bookings. For example, you could add a dropdown menu to filter bookings by status or a date range selector to filter bookings within a specific timeframe. Capture the user-selected filters and update the displayed bookings accordingly.

   Example code snippet for implementing filter options:

   ```javascript
   // Client-side code (JavaScript)

   const filterSelect = document.getElementById('filter-select');

   filterSelect.addEventListener('change', () => {
     const selectedFilter = filterSelect.value;

     // Filter bookings based on the selected filter
     let filteredBookings = bookings;

     if (selectedFilter !== 'all') {
       filteredBookings = bookings.filter((booking) => {
         return booking.status === selectedFilter;
       });
     }

     // Render the filtered bookings
     renderBookings(filteredBookings);
   });
   ```

6. **Update the Booking List**: Implement functions to update the displayed bookings based on search queries and filter options. These functions should re-render the booking list component with the updated bookings.

   Example code snippet for rendering bookings:

   ```javascript
   // Client-side code (JavaScript)

   function renderBookings(bookings) {
     const bookingListHTML = bookings.map((booking) => {
       return `
         <tr>
           <td>${booking.id}</td>
           <td>${booking.customerName}</td>
           <td>${booking.date}</td>
           <td>${booking.status}</td>
         </tr>
       `;
     }).join('');

     document.getElementById('booking-list').innerHTML = bookingListHTML;
   }
   ```

7. **Apply Styling and UI Enhancements**: Apply appropriate styles and UI enhancements to improve the readability and visual appeal of the booking list. Consider using CSS frameworks or libraries to streamline the styling process.

8. **Test the Functionality**: Test the booking list functionality by entering search queries, selecting filters, and verifying that the displayed bookings are updated accordingly. Ensure that the search and filter options produce the expected results.

By following these steps, you can successfully display a list of all bookings with search and filter options in the admin panel. Remember to adapt the code examples to the specific programming language and framework you are using for your project.

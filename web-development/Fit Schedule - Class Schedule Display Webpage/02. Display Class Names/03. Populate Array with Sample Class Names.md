1. Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
2. Create a new JavaScript file named "script.js" in the same directory as your HTML file.
   - For example, in Visual Studio Code, you can go to `File -> New File` and then save the file as "script.js" using `File -> Save` or the shortcut `Ctrl + S`.
3. Link the JavaScript file to the HTML file by adding the following line inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   ```html
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```
   
   Explanation:
   - The `<script>` tag is used to embed or reference external JavaScript files.
   - The `src` attribute specifies the path to the JavaScript file, in this case, "script.js".
   - Placing the `<script>` tag inside the `<head>` section ensures that the JavaScript code is loaded and executed before rendering the HTML content.

4. Now, let's declare an array variable to store the class names inside the "script.js" file. Add the following code:
   
   ```javascript
   // script.js
   
   // Declare an array variable to store the class names
   const classNames = [
     "Yoga",
     "Pilates",
     "Zumba",
     "Spin",
     "HIIT",
   ];
   ```
   
   Explanation:
   - We use the `const` keyword to declare a constant variable named `classNames`.
   - The square brackets `[ ]` represent an array literal, enclosing the class names as individual elements.
   - In this example, we have provided a few sample class names as strings, separated by commas.

5. Save the "script.js" file.

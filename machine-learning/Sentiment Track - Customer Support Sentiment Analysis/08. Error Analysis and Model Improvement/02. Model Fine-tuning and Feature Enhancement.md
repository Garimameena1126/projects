
# Fine-tune the model by incorporating additional features or adjusting the classification thresholds.

In this task, we will focus on improving the performance of the sentiment analysis model by incorporating additional features or adjusting the classification thresholds. By analyzing the misclassified samples, we can identify patterns or common errors made by the model, which can guide us in making the necessary adjustments. This process is crucial for refining the model and enhancing its accuracy.

Let's proceed with the step-by-step guide:

# Step 1: Analyze Misclassified Samples

To begin with, we need to analyze the misclassified samples to gain insights into the model's performance and identify potential areas of improvement. By examining these samples, we can understand the patterns or characteristics that contribute to misclassification.

1. Start by retrieving the misclassified samples from the testing dataset. These samples should contain both the input text and the predicted sentiment label.

   ```python
   misclassified_samples = []
   for i in range(len(test_X)):
       predicted_label = model.predict(test_X[i])
       if predicted_label != test_y[i]:
           misclassified_samples.append((test_X[i], predicted_label))
   ```

2. Once you have obtained the misclassified samples, analyze them to identify any recurring themes or patterns. Consider factors such as sentence structure, specific keywords, or contextual information that might influence the sentiment analysis.

   Example:
   ```
   Misclassified Sample 1:
   Text: "The product is great, but the customer service was terrible."
   Predicted Label: Positive
   True Label: Negative

   Misclassified Sample 2:
   Text: "I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of the item."
   Predicted Label: Positive
   True Label: Negative
   ```

   In the above examples, the model incorrectly classified negative sentiment as positive. This suggests a potential issue with handling negations or contextual cues that indicate negative sentiment.

# Step 2: Incorporate Additional Features

To improve the model's performance, we can consider incorporating additional features that provide more information for sentiment analysis. These features can complement the textual data and enhance the model's understanding of sentiment.

1. One common approach is to utilize sentiment lexicons or dictionaries, which contain words annotated with their associated sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral). By incorporating these lexicons into our model, we can leverage their predefined sentiment labels to improve classification accuracy.

   Example:
   ```python
   from nltk.corpus import sentiwordnet as swn

   def extract_sentiment_features(text):
       sentiment_score = 0
       token_count = 0
       for word in text.split():
           synsets = swn.senti_synsets(word)
           if synsets:
               sentiment_score += synsets[0].pos_score() - synsets[0].neg_score()
               token_count += 1
       if token_count > 0:
           average_sentiment = sentiment_score / token_count
           return average_sentiment
       else:
           return 0

   # Add sentiment features to the dataset
   train_X['sentiment_score'] = train_X['text'].apply(extract_sentiment_features)
   test_X['sentiment_score'] = test_X['text'].apply(extract_sentiment_features)
   ```

2. After incorporating the additional features, retrain the sentiment analysis model using the updated dataset.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Concatenate the sentiment features with the existing features
   train_X_with_features = pd.concat([train_X, train_X['sentiment_score']], axis=1)
   test_X_with_features = pd.concat([test_X, test_X['sentiment_score']], axis=1)

   # Retrain the model sing the updated dataset
   model.fit(train_X_with_features, train_y)
   ```

# Step 3: Adjust Classification Thresholds

Another approach to fine-tuning the model is by adjusting the classification thresholds. The classification threshold determines the point at which the model classifies a sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. By modifying these thresholds, we can influence the model's sensitivity and potentially improve its performance.

1. Start by obtaining the predicted probabilities of each sentiment class from the model.

   Example:
   ```python
   predicted_probabilities = model.predict_proba(test_X_with_features)
   ```

2. Examine the distribution of the predicted probabilities to gain insights into the model's confidence levels for each sentiment class.

   Example:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.hist(predicted_probabilities[:, 0], bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='Negative')
   plt.hist(predicted_probabilities[:, 1], bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='Neutral')
   plt.hist(predicted_probabilities[:, 2], bins=50, alpha=0.5, label='Positive')
   plt.xlabel('Predicted Probability')
   plt.ylabel('Frequency')
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```

3. Based on the distribution, you can adjust the classification thresholds to optimize the model's performance. For example, you may choose to lower the threshold for positive sentiment to capture more positive instances or increase the threshold for negative sentiment to reduce false negatives.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Adjust classification thresholds
   positive_threshold = 0.6
   negative_threshold = 0.3

   # Classify sentiment based on adjusted thresholds
   adjusted_sentiment = []
   for probabilities in predicted_probabilities:
       if probabilities[2] >= positive_threshold:
           adjusted_sentiment.append('Positive')
       elif probabilities[0] >= negative_threshold:
           adjusted_sentiment.append('Negative')
       else:
           adjusted_sentiment.append('Neutral')
   ```

4. Evaluate the model's performance using the adjusted classification thresholds by comparing the predictions to the true labels in the testing dataset.

   Example:
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

   print(classification_report(test_y, adjusted_sentiment))
   ```

   The classification report will provide metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which can help assess the impact of the adjustments made.

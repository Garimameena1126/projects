## Setting up a Simple Backend Server using Node.js with Express

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up a simple backend server for your web project using Node.js with the Express framework. We will cover the installation of Node.js, creating a basic Express server, and running the server locally. Let's get started!

### Step 1: Install Node.js

1. Download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

   Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed correctly by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

   You should see the version numbers of Node.js and npm printed in the console if the installation was successful.

### Step 2: Create a New Project Directory

1. Create a new directory for your backend server within your project directory. You can name it `backend` or any other suitable name.

   ```bash
   mkdir backend
   ```

2. Navigate to the newly created directory using the command line or your preferred file explorer.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

### Step 3: Initialize a New Node.js Project

1. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

   This will create a `package.json` file in your project directory, which will keep track of your project's dependencies and configuration.

2. Install the Express framework as a dependency by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

   This will download and install the Express framework in your project.

### Step 4: Create a Basic Express Server

1. Create a new JavaScript file within your `backend` directory and name it `server.js`. This file will contain the code for your Express server.

   ```bash
   touch server.js
   ```

2. Open the `server.js` file in a text editor.

   ```bash
   code server.js
   ```

3. Add the following code to set up a basic Express server in the `server.js` file:

   ```javascript
   // server.js

   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   // Define a route
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, World!');
   });

   // Start the server
   app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```

4. Save the `server.js` file.

### Step 5: Start the Backend Server

1. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `backend` directory if you're not already in it.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Start the backend server by running the following command:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   You should see the message "Server running at http://localhost:3000" logged in the console, indicating that the server is up and running.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

   You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in the browser, indicating that your backend server is successfully serving requests.

### Step 1: Choose a Location for Your Project Folder

First, decide where you want to create your project folder on your computer. Choose a location that is easily accessible and where you can organize your files effectively.

For example, you might choose to create your project folder on your desktop or within a specific directory on your computer. Remember this location as we'll use it in the following steps.

### Step 2: Create the Project Folder

Now that you have decided on a location, follow these steps to create the project folder:

1. Open your preferred file explorer or terminal.
2. Navigate to the desired location where you want to create your project folder.
3. Right-click within the location and select "New Folder" (or a similar option based on your operating system).

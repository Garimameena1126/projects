In this task, we will focus on preprocessing the user input to prepare it for sentiment analysis using the trained model. The preprocessing steps will involve cleaning the text, removing stop words, and vectorizing the input. Let's get started!

### Step 1: Set Up the Required Libraries

Before we begin, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. In this guide, we will be using Python and the following libraries:

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building APIs.
- **scikit-learn**: A machine learning library that provides tools for preprocessing text data.
- **nltk**: A library for natural language processing tasks, such as removing stop words.

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```shell
pip install flask scikit-learn nltk
```

### Step 2: Import the Required Modules

In your Python script, start by importing the required modules:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
import nltk
import joblib
```

### Step 3: Initialize Flask and Load the Trained Model

Next, initialize the Flask application and load the trained sentiment analysis model. Assuming you have a saved model file named `sentiment_model.pkl`, use the following code:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('sentiment_model.pkl')
```

### Step 4: Preprocess User Input

Now, let's define a route for the API endpoint where users can submit their customer support messages for sentiment analysis. Inside the route function, we will preprocess the user input by performing the following steps:

- Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
- Removing stop words: Removing common words that do not contribute much to the sentiment analysis.
- Vectorization: Converting the preprocessed text into a numerical representation using TF-IDF vectorization.

Here's the code to preprocess the user input:

```python
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict_sentiment():
    # Get the user input from the request
    user_input = request.json['message']

    # Tokenize the user input
    tokens = word_tokenize(user_input)

    # Remove stop words
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.casefold() not in stop_words]

    # Convert the filtered tokens back to a single string
    preprocessed_text = ' '.join(filtered_tokens)

    # Vectorize the preprocessed text using TF-IDF
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    vectorized_text = vectorizer.fit_transform([preprocessed_text])

    return jsonify({'preprocessed_text': preprocessed_text, 'vectorized_text': vectorized_text.toarray().tolist()})
```

### Step 5: Run the Flask Application

Finally, let's run the Flask application to start the API server. Add the following code at the end of your script:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### Step 6: Test the API

To test the API, you can use tools like cURL or Postman to send a POST request to the API endpoint (`http://localhost:5000/predict`) with the user input in the request body. The API will preprocess the user input, pass it to the trained model for sentiment prediction, and return the preprocessed text and vectorized representation as the API response.

That's

 it! You have successfully implemented the necessary logic to preprocess the user input and pass it to the trained model for sentiment prediction. Remember to save this script as a separate file and run it from the command line to start the API server.

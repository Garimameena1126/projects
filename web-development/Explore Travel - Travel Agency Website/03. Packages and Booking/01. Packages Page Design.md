# Designing a Packages Page

In this guide, we will design a packages page for your travel agency website. The packages page will display various travel packages offered by the agency. We will also include a search/filter functionality to help users find specific packages. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Set Up the Packages Page HTML Structure

1. Create a new HTML file named `packages.html` in your project folder.

2. Open the `packages.html` file in your preferred code editor.

3. Add the basic HTML structure to the file:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Travel Agency - Packages</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
      <nav>
        <!-- Add navigation links here -->
      </nav>
    
      <header>
        <!-- Add header content here -->
      </header>
    
      <main>
        <h1>Travel Packages</h1>
        <section id="search">
          <input type="text" id="search-input" placeholder="Search packages...">
        </section>
        <section id="packages">
          <!-- Add package cards here -->
        </section>
      </main>
    
      <footer>
        <!-- Add footer content here -->
      </footer>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

4. Replace `"path/to/style.css"` with the actual path to your CSS file.

5. Customize the navigation, header, and footer sections according to your design preferences.

## Step 2: Style the Packages Page

1. Open the `style.css` file in your code editor.

2. Add CSS rules specific to the packages page. For example, you can use the following CSS code as a starting point:

    ```css
    /* Style the packages page */
    #search {
      margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    
    #search-input {
      width: 100%;
      padding: 10px;
      font-size: 16px;
    }
    
    #packages {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
      gap: 20px;
    }
    
    .package-card {
      border: 1px solid #ddd;
      padding: 20px;
    }
    
    .package-card h2 {
      margin-top: 0;
    }
    
    .package-card p {
      margin-bottom: 0;
    }
    
    /* Add more styles as needed */
    ```

The CSS code above provides a basic layout for the packages page. It sets up the search input and organizes the packages into a grid. You can customize the styles further to match your design requirements.

## Step 3: Add Package Cards

1. Within the `#packages` section in the `packages.html` file, add individual package cards as follows:

    ```html
    <section id="packages">
      <div class="package-card">
        <h2>Package 1</h2>
        <p>Description of Package 1</p>
        <!-- Add more details or elements as needed -->
      </div>
      
      <div class="package-card">
        <h2>Package 2</h2>
        <p>Description of Package 2</p>
        <!-- Add more details or elements as needed -->
      </div>
    
      <!-- Add more package cards as needed -->
    </section>
    ```

2. Customize the package cards with relevant information, such as package names, descriptions, images, and prices.

## Step 4: Review and Enhance the Packages Page

1. Save the changes made to the `packages.html` and `style.css`files.

2. Open the `packages.html` file in your web browser to review the packages page.

3. Make necessary adjustments to the HTML and CSS code to improve the layout and design based on your preferences.

# Initializing a New Git Repository

In this task, we will initialize a new Git repository for your Order Tracking and Status Updates project. Initializing a Git repository allows you to track changes in your project, collaborate with others, and easily revert to previous versions when needed. Follow the steps below to initialize a new Git repository.

## Step 1: Open the Command Prompt or Terminal

Open the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) on your computer. This is the command line interface where you can run Git commands.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory where you created the basic file structure. Use the `cd` (change directory) command followed by the path to your project directory.

```bash
cd path/to/order-tracking-system
```

## Step 3: Initialize the Git Repository

To initialize a new Git repository, use the `git init` command. This command creates a new hidden `.git` directory within your project directory, which contains all the necessary files and metadata for Git to track changes.

```bash
git init
```

## Step 4: Verify the Git Initialization

To verify that the Git repository was successfully initialized, you can use the `ls -a` command (on macOS/Linux) or the `dir /a` command (on Windows) to list all the files and directories, including hidden ones.

```bash
ls -a
```

or

```bash
dir /a
```

You should see the newly created `.git` directory listed among the files and directories.

## Step 5: Configure Git

Git requires some initial configuration to associate your identity with the commits you make. Run the following commands to configure your name and email address:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Replace `"Your Name"` with your actual name and `"your.email@example.com"` with your actual email address. This information will be used in the commit history to identify the author of each commit.

## Step 6: Create an Initial Commit

To start tracking changes in your project, you need to make an initial commit. A commit represents a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.

1. Add all the files in your project directory to the Git staging area using the `git add` command. This tells Git to include these files in the next commit.

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    
    The `.` indicates that you want to add all the files and directories in the current directory.

2. Create a new commit with a meaningful commit message using the `git commit` command. The commit message should briefly describe the changes you made in this initial commit.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

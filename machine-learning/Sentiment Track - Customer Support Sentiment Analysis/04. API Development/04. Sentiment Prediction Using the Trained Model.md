
#  Return the Predicted Sentiment Label as the API Response

In this task, we will set up a backend server using Flask, a popular web framework in Python. We will create an API endpoint where users can submit customer support messages for sentiment analysis. The server will process the user input by preprocessing it and passing it to the trained sentiment analysis model. Finally, we will return the predicted sentiment label as the API response.

## Step 1: Install Flask

Before we begin, let's make sure Flask is installed. Open your command line or terminal and run the following command to install Flask:

```
pip install flask
```

## Step 2: Create a Flask App

Let's start by creating a new Python file called `app.py` and import the necessary modules:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define API endpoints and logic
# ...
```

We import the `Flask` class from the `flask` module and create an instance of the Flask application. We also import `request` to handle incoming requests and `jsonify` to convert our response into JSON format.

## Step 3: Define the API Endpoint

Now, let's define the API endpoint where users can submit their customer support messages. We'll use the `@app.route` decorator to specify the URL path for this endpoint and the HTTP method it should respond to. Add the following code below the previous import statements:

```python
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict_sentiment():
    message = request.json['message']
    
    # Preprocess the message
    # Pass the preprocessed message to the trained model for sentiment prediction
    # Get the predicted sentiment label
    
    response = {'sentiment': predicted_sentiment}
    return jsonify(response)
```

In this code, we define the `/predict` URL path and set it to accept `POST` requests. Inside the `predict_sentiment()` function, we retrieve the submitted message from the request's JSON payload using `request.json['message']`. 

## Step 4: Preprocess the Message and Predict Sentiment

Next, we need to preprocess the user input message and pass it to our trained sentiment analysis model for prediction. Modify the code within the `predict_sentiment()` function as follows:

```python
import preprocessing  # Assuming you have a separate preprocessing module

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict_sentiment():
    message = request.json['message']
    
    # Preprocess the message
    preprocessed_message = preprocessing.preprocess_message(message)
    
    # Pass the preprocessed message to the trained model for sentiment prediction
    predicted_sentiment = model.predict(preprocessed_message)
    
    response = {'sentiment': predicted_sentiment}
    return jsonify(response)
```

In this code, we assume you have a separate `preprocessing` module that contains a function `preprocess_message()` responsible for preprocessing the input message. Replace `preprocessing.preprocess_message()` with the appropriate preprocessing steps based on your implementation.

Assuming you have a trained sentiment analysis model stored in the variable `model`, you can use `model.predict()` to obtain the predicted sentiment label for the preprocessed message.

## Step 5: Run the Flask App

Finally, let's run the Flask app. Add the following code at the end of the `app.py` file:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Save the file and go to your command line or terminal. Navigate to the directory where `app.py` is located and run the following command:

```
python app.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see

 output indicating that the Flask app is running.

## Step 6: Test the API Endpoint

Now that the Flask app is running, we can test the API endpoint using a tool like cURL or Postman.

Make a `POST` request to `http://localhost:5000/predict` with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "message": "I'm having trouble with my order. Can you please help?"
}
```

You should receive a response similar to:

```json
{
  "sentiment": "negative"
}
```

The `sentiment` field in the response represents the predicted sentiment label for the submitted message.

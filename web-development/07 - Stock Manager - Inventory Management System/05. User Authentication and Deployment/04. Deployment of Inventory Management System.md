# Deploying the Inventory Management System

In this task, we will deploy the inventory management system to a hosting platform or a local server. Deploying the system allows it to be accessible to users over the internet or within a local network. We will explore two deployment options: deploying to a hosting platform (such as Heroku or AWS) and deploying to a local server.

## Option 1: Deploying to a Hosting Platform

### Step 1: Choose a Hosting Platform

1. Research different hosting platforms (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean) and choose the one that best suits your requirements, budget, and familiarity.

### Step 2: Set Up an Account

1. Create an account on the chosen hosting platform by visiting their website and following their registration process.

### Step 3: Prepare the Application for Deployment

1. Ensure that your inventory management system is fully functional and meets all the requirements for deployment. Test it thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

2. Update any necessary configuration files to work with the hosting platform. For example, you might need to configure environment variables or change the database connection settings.

### Step 4: Configure the Hosting Platform

1. Log in to your hosting platform account and navigate to the dashboard or control panel.

2. Create a new project or application within the hosting platform. Follow their documentation or guides to understand the steps specific to the chosen platform.

3. Configure the project settings, such as the application name, domain name, region, and any additional services or add-ons required by your system.

### Step 5: Deploy the Application

1. Connect your local development environment to the hosting platform. The exact process may vary depending on the platform, but generally, you will need to set up version control integration (e.g., Git) or use a deployment tool provided by the hosting platform.

2. Push your code to the hosting platform's repository or trigger the deployment process through the provided deployment tool.

3. Monitor the deployment process, and ensure that there are no errors or issues reported during the deployment.

### Step 6: Test the Deployed Application

1. Once the deployment is complete, access the deployed application using the provided URL or domain.

2. Test all the features and functionalities of the inventory management system to ensure that it works correctly in the deployed environment.

## Option 2: Deploying to a Local Server

### Step 1: Set Up a Local Server Environment

1. Install the necessary software to set up a local server environment. You can use tools like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP to install a web server, PHP, and a database (such as MySQL) on your local machine.

### Step 2: Configure the Server Environment

1. Copy the inventory management system files to the appropriate directory in your local server environment. This is typically the "htdocs" or "www" directory within the server installation directory.

2. Configure the server environment by updating the necessary configuration files. This may involve setting up the database connection, configuring the web server, or adjusting any other relevant settings.

### Step 3: Start the Local Server

1. Start the local server environment by launching the server software. This will start the web server, PHP, and the associated services.

### Step 4: Access the Application

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the local server's URL or IP address. This will typically be something like "http://localhost" or "http://127.0.0.1".

2. Verify that the inventory management system is accessible and functioning correctly in the local server environment.

In this task, we will learn how to optimize the loading speed of a website by minifying and compressing CSS and JavaScript files.

### Step 1: Minify CSS Files

1. Identify the CSS files used in your project.
   - Locate the `<link>` tags with `rel="stylesheet"` in your HTML files.
2. Install a CSS minification tool or use an online minification service.
   - Popular tools include UglifyCSS, cssnano, and online services like CSS Minifier.
3. Use the chosen tool to minify your CSS files.
   - Follow the tool's documentation or guidelines on how to minify CSS.
   - Typically, you'll provide the CSS file(s) as input and obtain the minified version as output.
4. Replace the original CSS files in your project with the minified versions.
   - Update the `<link>` tags in your HTML files to point to the minified CSS files.

### Step 2: Minify JavaScript Files

1. Identify the JavaScript files used in your project.
   - Locate the `<script>` tags or external JavaScript file references in your HTML files.
2. Install a JavaScript minification tool or use an online minification service.
   - Popular tools include UglifyJS, Terser, and online services like JavaScript Minifier.
3. Use the chosen tool to minify your JavaScript files.
   - Follow the tool's documentation or guidelines on how to minify JavaScript.
   - Typically, you'll provide the JavaScript file(s) as input and obtain the minified version as output.
4. Replace the original JavaScript files in your project with the minified versions.
   - Update the `<script>` tags or external file references in your HTML files to point to the minified JavaScript files.

### Step 3: Compress CSS and JavaScript Files

1. Enable Gzip compression on your web server.
   - Consult your web hosting provider's documentation or support resources to enable Gzip compression.
   - If you're using Apache, you can typically enable Gzip compression by adding the following code to your .htaccess file:
     ```apache
     <IfModule mod_deflate.c>
       <FilesMatch "\.(html|css|js|xml|txt|php)$">
         SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
       </FilesMatch>
     </IfModule>
     ```
2. Verify that Gzip compression is working by checking the response headers of your website's CSS and JavaScript files.
   - You can use browser developer tools or online tools like GIDZipTest or GTmetrix.
   - Look for the "Content-Encoding" header, which should indicate "gzip" for compressed files.

# Implement User Authentication Middleware to Protect Sensitive Routes

In this task, we will implement user authentication middleware to protect sensitive routes in our workout tracking app. User authentication ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes that contain sensitive or private information. By implementing this middleware, we can enhance the security and privacy of our application.

Follow the steps below to implement user authentication middleware:

## Step 1: Understand the Concept of User Authentication Middleware

User authentication middleware is a piece of code that intercepts incoming requests and verifies whether the user making the request is authenticated or not. It is placed before the route handlers and can be used to protect sensitive routes by requiring users to authenticate before accessing them.

In our workout tracking app, we will use user authentication middleware to protect routes that contain sensitive user information, such as the user's workout log, progress tracking, and fitness goals.

## Step 2: Create a Middleware File

1. Inside your project's `src` directory, create a new folder called `middleware`.

2. Inside the `middleware` folder, create a new file called `authMiddleware.js`.

3. Open the `authMiddleware.js` file in your code editor.

## Step 3: Implement the User Authentication Middleware

In the `authMiddleware.js` file, write the following code to implement the user authentication middleware:

```javascript
// authMiddleware.js

// Import any necessary dependencies
// For example, if you are using Express.js:
// const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
// const { SECRET_KEY } = require('../config');

// Create the authentication middleware function
const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  // Get the authentication token from the request headers
  const token = req.headers.authorization;

  // Check if the token is present
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  }

  try {
    // Verify the token
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY);

    // Attach the user's ID to the request object for future use
    req.userId = decoded.userId;

    // Call the next middleware or route handler
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
  }
};

// Export the middleware function
module.exports = authMiddleware;
```

Make sure to uncomment and import any necessary dependencies, such as `jsonwebtoken` and the `SECRET_KEY` from your application's configuration file.

This middleware function performs the following steps:
1. Retrieves the authentication token from the request headers.
2. Checks if the token is present. If not, it sends a 401 Unauthorized response.
3. Verifies the token using the secret key.
4. If the token is valid, it attaches the user's ID to the request object for future use.
5. Calls the next middleware or route handler to continue processing the request.

## Step 4: Use the User Authentication Middleware

To protect sensitive routes using the user authentication middleware, follow these steps:

1. Open the file where you define your routes or controllers (e.g., `exerciseRoutes.js`, `userRoutes.js`).

2. Import the `authMiddleware` function at the top of the file:

```javascript
const authMiddleware = require('../middleware/authMiddleware');
```

3. Apply the `authMiddleware` to the routes that require authentication. For example:

```javascript
// Apply the authMiddleware to protect the workout log route
router.get('/workout-log', authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  // Handle the request logic here
});

// Apply the authMiddleware to protect the progress tracking route
router.get('/progress', authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  // Handle the request

 logic here
});

// Apply the authMiddleware to protect the fitness goals route
router.get('/goals', authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  // Handle the request logic here
});
```

By adding `authMiddleware` as a second argument to the route handler functions, we ensure that these routes can only be accessed by authenticated users.

## Step 5: Test the User Authentication Middleware

To test the user authentication middleware, follow these steps:

1. Start your web server or development environment.

2. Make a request to one of the protected routes (e.g., `/workout-log`, `/progress`, `/goals`) without providing a valid authentication token.

3. Verify that the server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status and an appropriate error message.

4. Obtain a valid authentication token (e.g., by logging in as a user).

5. Include the authentication token in the request headers as the `Authorization` field with the value `Bearer <token>`. For example:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

6. Make a request to one of the protected routes with the valid authentication token.

7. Verify that the server allows access to the route and executes the corresponding route handler logic.

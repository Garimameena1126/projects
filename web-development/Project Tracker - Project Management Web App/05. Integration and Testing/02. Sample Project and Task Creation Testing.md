In this guide, we will test the application by creating sample projects and tasks, ensuring that the data is correctly saved and retrieved from the backend.

### Step 1: Prepare Test Data

1. Identify the test data you want to use for creating sample projects and tasks.
2. Determine the structure and format of the test data, including the required fields such as project name, task description, due date, etc.
3. Prepare an array or object representing the test data in your preferred programming language. For example:
   ```javascript
   const sampleProjects = [
     { name: 'Project A', tasks: ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3'] },
     { name: 'Project B', tasks: ['Task 4', 'Task 5'] },
     // Add more sample projects and tasks as needed
   ];
   ```

### Step 2: Write Test Cases

1. Open your testing framework or testing file.
2. Write test cases to cover the scenarios you want to test. For example, you can write test cases to:
   - Create a project with tasks and verify that it is saved correctly.
   - Retrieve the created projects and tasks from the backend and verify their correctness.
   - Update a task's status or due date and ensure the changes are reflected in the retrieved data.
3. Each test case should have a clear purpose and expected outcome.

### Step 3: Implement Test Cases

1. Begin with the first test case from Step 2.
2. Write the necessary code to execute the test case and verify the expected outcome.
3. Use the testing framework's assertion methods to validate the correctness of the application's behavior. For example, if you're using a JavaScript testing library like Jest, you can use its `expect` function:
   ```javascript
   test('Creating a project with tasks should save the data correctly', () => {
     // Create the project and tasks using the sample data
     // Make API calls to save the data to the backend
     // Retrieve the saved data from the backend
   
     // Perform assertions to verify the correctness of the saved data
     expect(savedData).toEqual(sampleProjects);
   });
   ```

### Step 4: Run Tests

1. Open your command line or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where your tests are located.
3. Run the command to execute the tests using your testing framework. For example, if you're using Jest, you can run `npm test` or `jest`:
   ```
   $ npm test
   ```
4. Observe the test results in the command line or terminal.
5. Check if all the tests passed successfully. If any tests failed, review the failure messages to identify the issues.

### Step 5: Fix Issues and Re-run Tests

1. If any tests failed, investigate the failure messages and identify the issues.
2. Make the necessary adjustments to your code to fix the issues.
3. Repeat Step 4 by re-running the tests to ensure that the fixes resolved the problems.
4. Continue fixing any additional issues until all tests pass successfully.

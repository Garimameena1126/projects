1. **Review Data Structure**: Ensure that you have a proper data structure to store the reviews and their associated ratings. Each review should have a rating field.

2. **Retrieve Reviews**: Retrieve the reviews from the database or any other storage mechanism. You should have a way to fetch all the reviews.

   Example code snippet for retrieving reviews:

   ```javascript
   // Assuming you have a function to retrieve reviews from the database
   const reviews = retrieveReviews();

   // reviews will be an array of review objects
   // Each review object should have a rating field
   ```

3. **Calculate Average Rating**: Iterate over the reviews and calculate the average rating. To calculate the average, sum up all the ratings and divide by the total number of reviews.

   Example code snippet for calculating the average rating:

   ```javascript
   let totalRating = 0;
   let averageRating = 0;

   for (const review of reviews) {
     totalRating += review.rating;
   }

   if (reviews.length > 0) {
     averageRating = totalRating / reviews.length;
   }
   ```

4. **Display Average Rating**: Present the average rating on the user interface, whether it's a web page, mobile app, or any other platform. Use the calculated average rating to populate the appropriate area on the UI.

   Example code snippet for displaying the average rating:

   ```javascript
   // Assuming you have a DOM element to display the average rating
   const averageRatingElement = document.getElementById('average-rating');

   // Set the text content of the element to the calculated average rating
   averageRatingElement.textContent = averageRating.toFixed(2); // Display averageRating with 2 decimal places
   ```

5. **Update Average Rating**: Whenever a new review is submitted or an existing review is edited or deleted, recalculate the average rating to reflect the changes. Call the calculation function again and update the displayed average rating on the UI.

   Example code snippet for updating the average rating:

   ```javascript
   function updateAverageRating() {
     // Recalculate average rating
     let totalRating = 0;
     let averageRating = 0;

     for (const review of reviews) {
       totalRating += review.rating;
     }

     if (reviews.length > 0) {
       averageRating = totalRating / reviews.length;
     }

     // Update the displayed average rating on the UI
     averageRatingElement.textContent = averageRating.toFixed(2);
   }

   // Call the updateAverageRating function whenever a review is added, edited, or deleted
   // This ensures that the average rating is always up to date
   ```

## Module 6: Hyperparameter Tuning

In this module, we will explore different hyperparameter settings for the chosen regression model in order to improve its performance. Hyperparameters are configuration settings that are not learned from the data, but rather set manually before training the model. By tuning these hyperparameters, we can optimize the model's performance and enhance its predictive accuracy. We will use techniques like grid search or random search to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters.

### Step 1: Understand Hyperparameters

Before we begin tuning the hyperparameters, let's understand what they are and how they affect the model. Hyperparameters are settings that determine the behavior of the learning algorithm. They are not learned from the data itself, but rather set manually by the developer. Some common hyperparameters include learning rate, number of estimators, maximum depth, regularization parameters, etc.

Each hyperparameter has a range of possible values, and selecting the right combination can significantly impact the model's performance. Tuning hyperparameters involves systematically testing different values and evaluating the model's performance with each setting.

### Step 2: Choose a Hyperparameter Tuning Technique

There are various techniques for hyperparameter tuning, but two popular approaches are grid search and random search. Let's briefly understand each technique:

**Grid Search**: Grid search exhaustively searches through a predefined set of hyperparameter combinations. It creates a grid of all possible values for each hyperparameter and evaluates the model's performance for each combination. Grid search is computationally expensive but guarantees to find the best combination within the given search space.

**Random Search**: Random search randomly samples hyperparameter combinations from a predefined search space. Unlike grid search, it does not evaluate every possible combination. Instead, it randomly selects a specific number of combinations and evaluates their performance. Random search is less computationally expensive than grid search and can be effective when the search space is large.

For this guide, let's use the grid search technique to tune the hyperparameters of our regression model.

### Step 3: Define the Hyperparameter Search Space

Before we can perform grid search, we need to define the search space for each hyperparameter. The search space is a range of possible values that we want to explore. Let's consider an example where we want to tune the hyperparameters for a Random Forest regression model. We will tune the following hyperparameters:

- `n_estimators`: The number of decision trees in the Random Forest.
- `max_depth`: The maximum depth of each decision tree.
- `min_samples_split`: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.

For each hyperparameter, we will define a range of values to search within. Here's an example of how we can define the search space:

- `n_estimators`: [50, 100, 150, 200]
- `max_depth`: [5, 10, 15]
- `min_samples_split`: [2, 5, 10]

In this example, we will test four values for `n_estimators`, three values for `max_depth`, and three values for `min_samples_split`.

### Step 4: Perform Grid Search

Now that we have defined the search space, let's perform the grid search using scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` class. This class automates the process of grid search and cross-validation. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Define the hyperparameter search space
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 150, 200],
    'max_depth': [5, 10, 15],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

# Create the regression model


model = RandomForestRegressor()

# Create the GridSearchCV object
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error', cv=5)

# Fit the grid search to the training data
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the best hyperparameters and model
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
```

In the above code snippet, `X_train` represents the feature matrix of the training data, and `y_train` represents the corresponding target variable.

### Step 5: Evaluate the Best Model

After the grid search is complete, we can evaluate the performance of the best model obtained from the search. We can use evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) to assess the model's predictive accuracy. Here's an example code snippet to evaluate the best model:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Make predictions with the best model
y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Print the MSE
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

In the above code snippet, `X_test` represents the feature matrix of the testing data, and `y_test` represents the corresponding target variable.

### Step 6: Refine the Hyperparameter Search Space (Optional)

If the performance of the best model obtained from the grid search is not satisfactory, you can refine the search space and perform another round of grid search. This iterative process allows you to further narrow down the hyperparameter settings and potentially improve the model's performance. Experiment with different ranges and values for the hyperparameters to find the optimal configuration.

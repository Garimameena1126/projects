To implement a feature to schedule follow-up tasks for leads, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Design the Follow-up Task Data Structure

Determine the data structure to store follow-up tasks for leads. Identify the necessary fields such as task ID, lead ID, task description, due date, and task status.

Here's an example of how the follow-up task data structure might look:

| Field Name   | Data Type    | Description                                |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| id           | INTEGER      | Unique identifier for each follow-up task   |
| lead_id      | INTEGER      | Foreign key referencing the lead table      |
| description  | TEXT         | Description of the follow-up task           |
| due_date     | DATE         | Due date for completing the follow-up task  |
| status       | VARCHAR(20)  | Status of the follow-up task (e.g., pending, completed) |

## Step 2: Create the Follow-up Task Table

Using a database management tool (e.g., SQL command-line interface, database GUI tool, ORM), execute the necessary SQL command to create the follow-up task table.

Here's an example of how the SQL command might look:

```sql
CREATE TABLE follow_up_tasks (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  lead_id INTEGER,
  description TEXT,
  due_date DATE,
  status VARCHAR(20)
);
```

Adjust the SQL statement based on your database system and any additional requirements.

## Step 3: Update the Application Code

Update your application code to implement the functionality for scheduling follow-up tasks.

When a user wants to schedule a follow-up task for a lead, capture the relevant information (e.g., lead ID, task description, due date) and insert a new row into the follow-up task table.

Here's an example of how the code might look in a server-side language like Python using SQL queries:

```python
# Example Python code for scheduling follow-up tasks
import sqlite3

def schedule_follow_up_task(lead_id, description, due_date):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    query = '''
        INSERT INTO follow_up_tasks (lead_id, description, due_date, status)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, 'pending')
    '''
    cursor.execute(query, (lead_id, description, due_date))
    conn.commit()

    conn.close()
```

Adjust the code based on your chosen programming language, database system, and any specific frameworks or libraries you're using.

## Step 4: Update the Task Management User Interface

Update your task management user interface to allow users to schedule follow-up tasks for leads.

Provide a form or input fields where users can enter the necessary information for scheduling a follow-up task, such as lead ID, task description, and due date.

When the user submits the form, call the appropriate function in your application code (e.g., `schedule_follow_up_task()`) to store the follow-up task in the database.

## Step 5: Test the Follow-up Task Scheduling Functionality

To ensure that the follow-up task scheduling functionality works correctly, perform tests.

Create follow-up tasks for different leads with varying descriptions and due dates. Verify that the follow-up tasks are stored correctly in the follow-up task table.

Retrieve and display the follow-up tasks for a specific lead to verify the functionality.

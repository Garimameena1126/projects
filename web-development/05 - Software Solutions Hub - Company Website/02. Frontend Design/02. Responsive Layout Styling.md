In this task, we will add CSS styles to create a responsive layout for the website. This will ensure that the website looks good and adapts well to different devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Follow the steps below to add the necessary CSS styles:

## Step 1: Create a CSS File

1. Open your preferred code editor.
2. Create a new CSS file and save it with a meaningful name, such as `styles.css`.
3. Link the CSS file to your HTML file by adding the following line inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

## Step 2: Set Up the Responsive Meta Tag

1. Inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file, add the following meta tag to ensure proper rendering and scaling on different devices:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

## Step 3: Add CSS Styles

1. Open the `styles.css` file.
2. Start by resetting the default styles to create a clean slate. You can use a CSS reset library or write your own. For example:
```css
/* CSS Reset */
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
3. Define the basic styles for your website's layout. For example, you can use a container element to wrap your website's content and center it on the page:
```css
.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
4. Implement a responsive layout using media queries. Media queries allow you to apply specific styles based on the device's screen size. For example, you can change the layout and adjust the sizes of elements for smaller screens:
```css
/* Media Queries */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for screens smaller than 768px */
  
  .container {
    padding: 10px;
  }
}
```
5. Apply additional styles to different sections of your website to make them visually appealing. For example, you can style the header section with a background color, set font styles, and adjust the spacing:
```css
/* Header Styles */
header {
  background-color: #333;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}

header h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

header p {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```
6. Continue adding CSS styles for the navigation, services, team, portfolio, and footer sections according to your design requirements.

## Step 4: Save and Apply the Styles

1. Save the `styles.css` file.
2. Refresh your website in the browser and observe the changes. The website should now have a responsive layout and the sections should be styled according to your CSS rules.

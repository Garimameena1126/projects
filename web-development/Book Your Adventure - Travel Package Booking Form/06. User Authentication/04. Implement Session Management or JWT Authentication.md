Implementing session management or JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication allows you to maintain user sessions and securely authenticate requests. Follow the steps below to implement this functionality in your project.

1. Choose an Authentication Method
   - Decide whether you want to implement session-based authentication or JWT-based authentication. Each method has its own advantages and considerations.
   - Session-based authentication uses server-side sessions to maintain user state. When a user logs in, a session is created on the server, and a unique session identifier is stored in a cookie on the client-side. Subsequent requests include this session identifier for authentication.
   - JWT-based authentication uses digitally signed tokens to authenticate requests. When a user logs in, they receive a JWT containing their user information and a signature. This token is sent with each subsequent request for authentication.
   - Choose the authentication method that best suits your project's requirements and security considerations.

2. Implement Session-Based Authentication
   - If you choose session-based authentication, start by configuring session management in your server-side application framework.
   - Configure session storage settings, such as storing sessions in memory or using a persistent storage mechanism like a database.
   - Set up session encryption to protect session data from tampering.
   - Implement endpoints to handle user login, session creation, and session validation.
   - When a user logs in, create a session for them on the server and send a unique session identifier (e.g., a session ID) to the client as a cookie.
   - For each subsequent request, check the session identifier from the client's cookie and validate it on the server to authenticate the user.
   - Be sure to handle session expiration, logout, and other related functionalities as per your project's requirements.

3. Implement JWT-Based Authentication
   - If you choose JWT-based authentication, start by configuring JWT settings in your server-side application framework.
   - Generate a secret key used to sign and verify JWTs. This key should be kept secure and should not be exposed.
   - Implement endpoints to handle user login and JWT generation.
   - When a user logs in, generate a JWT containing the user's information and sign it using the secret key.
   - Send the JWT to the client as a response.
   - For each subsequent request, include the JWT in the request header (e.g., as the `Authorization` header) for authentication.
   - On the server-side, verify the JWT signature and extract the user information to authenticate the request.
   - Handle token expiration, refresh tokens, and other related functionalities as per your project's requirements.

4. Handle Authentication Errors
   - Implement error handling for authentication failures, such as invalid credentials, expired sessions, or tampered tokens.
   - Return appropriate error responses to the client and provide clear error messages to assist with debugging and user feedback.

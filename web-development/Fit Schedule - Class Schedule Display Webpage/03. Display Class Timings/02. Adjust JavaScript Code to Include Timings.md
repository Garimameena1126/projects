#### Task: Modify the existing array of class names to include associated timings for each class.

1. Open your JavaScript file named "script.js" in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
2. Locate the existing array variable that stores the class names. It might look something like this:

```javascript
// Existing array of class names
const classNames = [
  "Yoga",
  "Zumba",
  "Pilates"
];
```

3. Modify the existing array to include associated timings for each class. You can achieve this by using an array of objects, where each object represents a class with its name and timing. Update the array to something like this:

```javascript
// Modified array of class names with timings
const classNames = [
  {
    name: "Yoga",
    timing: "9:00 AM - 10:00 AM"
  },
  {
    name: "Zumba",
    timing: "11:00 AM - 12:00 PM"
  },
  {
    name: "Pilates",
    timing: "2:00 PM - 3:00 PM"
  }
];
```

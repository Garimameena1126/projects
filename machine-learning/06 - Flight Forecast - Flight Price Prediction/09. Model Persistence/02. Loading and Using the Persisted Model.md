# Beginner's Guide: Loading and Using a Persisted Machine Learning Model

In this guide, we will learn how to load a trained machine learning model from disk and use it to make predictions without the need for retraining. This process is known as model persistence and is a crucial step when you want to deploy your machine learning model in a production environment. We will assume that you have already trained a model and saved it to disk. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Import Required Libraries

First, we need to import the necessary libraries to load and use the persisted model. In this example, we will be using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.

```python
import joblib
```

## Step 2: Load the Persisted Model

Next, we will load the trained model from disk using the `joblib` library's `load()` function. Make sure you provide the correct path to the saved model file.

```python
model = joblib.load('path/to/saved_model.pkl')
```

## Step 3: Make Predictions using the Loaded Model

Now that we have loaded the model, we can use it to make predictions on new data. Let's assume you have new flight data that you want to predict prices for. You need to preprocess this new data using the same steps you used during training (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling). Once the data is preprocessed, you can pass it to the loaded model's `predict()` function to obtain the predicted flight prices.

Here's an example of how to make predictions using the loaded model:

```python
new_data = preprocess_new_data(new_flight_data)  # Preprocess new data using the same steps as during training
predictions = model.predict(new_data)  # Make predictions using the loaded model
```

The `predictions` variable will now contain the predicted flight prices based on the new data.

## Step 4: Use the Predictions

Once you have the predictions, you can use them in various ways depending on your application. For example, you might want to display the predicted prices to the user or perform further analysis on the predicted values.

```python
for prediction in predictions:
    print(f"Predicted price: {prediction}")
```

Feel free to customize the usage of predictions based on your specific project requirements.

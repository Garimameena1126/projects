# Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up a Basic HTML/CSS Template for the Frontend

In this task, we will create a basic HTML/CSS template for the frontend of our exercise logging tool project. This template will serve as the foundation for building the user interface of our application.

## Prerequisites

- Code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed

## Steps

1. **Open Code Editor**

   Launch your preferred code editor or IDE.

2. **Navigate to the Frontend Folder**

   Open the project directory and navigate to the "frontend" folder. This is where we will create our HTML and CSS files.

3. **Create HTML File**

   Create a new file named `index.html` inside the "frontend" folder. This file will be the main HTML file for our application.

4. **Set Up HTML Structure**

   In the `index.html` file, set up the basic structure of an HTML document using the following code:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Exercise Log</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
   </head>
   <body>
       <header>
           <!-- Header content goes here -->
       </header>
   
       <main>
           <!-- Main content goes here -->
       </main>
   
       <footer>
           <!-- Footer content goes here -->
       </footer>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   This code sets up the basic HTML structure with a document type declaration, `<html>` root element, and `<head>` and `<body>` sections. It also includes a `<title>` element for the page title and a link to an external CSS file.

5. **Create CSS File**

   Inside the "frontend" folder, create a new folder called "css" if it doesn't already exist. Then, create a file named `styles.css` inside the "css" folder. This file will contain the CSS styles for our application.

6. **Style the Header, Main, and Footer**

   In the `styles.css` file, add the following CSS code to style the header, main content, and footer of our application:

   ```css
   /* styles.css */
   
   /* Reset default margin and padding */
   body, header, main, footer {
       margin: 0;
       padding: 0;
   }
   
   /* Style the header */
   header {
       background-color: #f2f2f2;
       padding: 10px;
       text-align: center;
   }
   
   /* Style the main content */
   main {
       padding: 20px;
   }
   
   /* Style the footer */
   footer {
       background-color: #f2f2f2;
       padding: 10px;
       text-align: center;
   }
   ```

   This code resets the default margin and padding for the `<body>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` elements. It then applies specific styles to each of these sections, such as background colors, padding, and text alignment.

7. **Add Content to Header, Main, and Footer**

   Inside the `index.html` file, add some content to the header, main, and footer sections. For example:

   ```html
   <header>
       <h1>Exercise Log</h1>
   </header>
   
   <main>
       <h2>Welcome to the Exercise Log App!</h2>
       <p>This app helps you track your daily exercises and monitor your

 progress.</p>
   </main>
   
   <footer>
       <p>&copy; 2023 Exercise Log. All rights reserved.</p>
   </footer>
   ```

   Feel free to customize the content and structure of these sections to fit the needs of your application.

8. **Preview the HTML Page**

   Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see a preview of the basic HTML/CSS template you've created. You should see the header, main content, and footer styled according to the CSS rules you defined.

   ```plaintext
   exercise-log/
   ├── frontend/
   │   ├── css/
   │   │   └── styles.css
   │   └── index.html
   └── backend/
   ```

9. **Congratulations!**

   You have successfully set up a basic HTML/CSS template for the frontend of your exercise logging tool project. This template provides a starting point for building the user interface and styling it according to your application's requirements.

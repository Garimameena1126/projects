1. Ensure you have set up a frontend framework or library of your choice (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) and have a basic project structure in place. If not, refer to the documentation for your chosen framework to set up a new project.

2. Create a new component for the bookings page. In your project directory, navigate to the relevant folder for components and create a new file called `BookingsPage.js`.

3. Open the `BookingsPage.js` file in your preferred code editor.

4. Import the necessary modules at the top of the file. For example, in React:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
   import axios from 'axios';
   ```

5. Define the functional component for the bookings page. Inside the component, declare a state variable to store the bookings data:
   ```javascript
   function BookingsPage() {
     const [bookings, setBookings] = useState([]);
     
     // Fetch bookings data from the server and update the state
     useEffect(() => {
       axios.get('/api/bookings')  // Adjust the API endpoint according to your server setup
         .then(response => {
           setBookings(response.data);
         })
         .catch(error => {
           console.error('Error fetching bookings:', error);
         });
     }, []);
     
     return (
       <div>
         {/* Render the bookings data */}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

6. Add the necessary markup and styling to display the bookings data in the component's return statement. For example:
   ```javascript
   return (
     <div>
       <h1>My Bookings</h1>
       <ul>
         {bookings.map(booking => (
           <li key={booking.id}>
             <p>Package: {booking.packageName}</p>
             <p>Date: {booking.date}</p>
             {/* Add other booking details as needed */}
           </li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     </div>
   );
   ```

   Adjust the JSX markup based on your preferred styling and component structure.

7. Save the `BookingsPage.js` file.

8. Use the `BookingsPage` component in your application. This will depend on your chosen frontend framework. For example, in React, you might update your main `App.js` file or a relevant route component to include the `BookingsPage` component.

9. Start your frontend development server if it's not already running.

10. Navigate to the bookings page in your application to see the list of bookings rendered.

In this task, we will focus on making the form and website responsive by modifying the existing CSS styles. Follow the steps below to accomplish this.

1. Identify the Target Elements
   - Examine the HTML structure of your form and website.
   - Identify the elements that need to be modified to achieve responsiveness.
   - These elements may include the form inputs, buttons, navigation menus, images, or other components that require adjustments based on different screen sizes.

2. Define the Responsive Breakpoints
   - Determine the breakpoints at which the layout and styles should adapt.
   - Common breakpoints are typically based on screen sizes, such as mobile, tablet, and desktop.
   - Choose the breakpoints that align with the design requirements and the devices you want to support.

3. Apply Media Queries
   - Use CSS media queries to apply different styles based on the screen width.
   - Within your CSS file, write media queries targeting specific breakpoints.
   - Modify the CSS properties within each media query to adjust the styles for different screen sizes.
   - Start with the smallest breakpoint (e.g., mobile) and progressively add media queries for larger screen sizes.

4. Adjust Layout and Styles
   - Within each media query, modify the CSS styles to ensure proper layout and appearance.
   - Use CSS properties like width, height, margins, paddings, and flexbox/grid to control the layout and positioning of elements.
   - Adjust font sizes, colors, and other visual aspects to improve readability and aesthetics on different screen sizes.
   - Consider rearranging or hiding elements as needed to optimize the user experience on smaller screens.

5. Test Responsiveness
   - Open your form and website on different devices, screen sizes, and orientations to test responsiveness.
   - Use browser developer tools to simulate various screen sizes and view the changes made by the media queries.
   - Ensure that the elements adapt well to different screen sizes without overlapping or causing horizontal scrollbars.
   - Verify that the content remains readable and accessible on all devices.

### Example Code Snippet:

CSS:
```css
/* Styles for the form inputs and buttons */
input[type="text"], input[type="email"], input[type="password"], textarea {
  /* Set desired width and height */
  width: 100%;
  height: 40px;
  /* Add appropriate margins and paddings */
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
}

button {
  /* Set desired width and height */
  width: 100%;
  height: 40px;
  /* Add appropriate margins and paddings */
  margin-top: 10px;
  padding: 5px;
}

/* Media query for mobile devices */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  input[type="text"], input[type="email"], input[type="password"], textarea {
    /* Adjust styles for mobile */
    height: 30px;
    font-size: 14px;
  }

  button {
    /* Adjust styles for mobile */
    height: 30px;
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}

/* Media query for tablet devices */
@media screen and (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  /* Adjust styles for tablets */
  /* Add specific styles here */
}

/* Media query for desktop devices */
@media screen and (min-width: 1025px) {
  /* Adjust styles for desktop */
  /* Add specific styles here */
}
```

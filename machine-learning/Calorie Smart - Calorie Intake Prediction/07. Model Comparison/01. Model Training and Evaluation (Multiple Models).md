# Model Training and Evaluation (Multiple Models)

This guide will walk you through the process of training and evaluating multiple models for the Calorie Smart - Calorie Intake Prediction project. We will use a variety of models to predict calorie intake based on input features such as age, gender, weight, height, and activity level. Follow the steps below to build and evaluate the models.

## Step 1: Data Preparation

Before we can train our models, we need to prepare the data. Follow these steps to preprocess the dataset:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    ```

2. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame:
    ```python
    data = pd.read_csv('calorie_intake_data.csv')
    ```

3. Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y):
    ```python
    X = data.drop('calorie_intake', axis=1)
    y = data['calorie_intake']
    ```

4. Split the data into training and testing sets:
    ```python
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    ```

5. Perform feature scaling on the training and testing sets:
    ```python
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
    ```

## Step 2: Model Training and Evaluation

Now that our data is prepared, we can proceed with training and evaluating multiple models. Follow these steps to train and evaluate the models:

### Model 1: Linear Regression

1. Import the necessary libraries:
    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
    ```

2. Create an instance of the LinearRegression model:
```python
model_lr = LinearRegression()
```

3. Fit the model to the training data:
    ```python
    model_lr.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
    ```

4. Make predictions on the test data:
    ```python
    y_pred_lr = model_lr.predict(X_test_scaled)
    ```

5. Evaluate the model's performance:
    ```python
    mse_lr = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_lr)
    r2_lr = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_lr)
    ```

### Model 2: Random Forest Regression

1. Import the necessary libraries:
    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    ```

2. Create an instance of the RandomForestRegressor model:
    ```python
    model_rf = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
    ```

3. Fit the model to the training data:
    ```python
    model_rf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
    ```

4. Make predictions on the test data:
    ```python
    y_pred_rf = model_rf.predict(X_test_scaled)
    ```

5. Evaluate the model's performance:
    ```python
    mse_rf = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_rf)
    r2_rf = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_rf)
    ```

### Model 3: Support Vector Regression

1. Import the necessary libraries:
    ```python
    from sklearn.svm import SVR
    ```

2. Create an instance of the SVR model:
    ```python
    model_svr = SVR()
    ```

3. Fit the model to the training data:
    ```python
    model_svr.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
    ```

4. Make predictions on the test data:
    ```python
    y_pred_svr = model_svr.predict(X_test_scaled)
    ```

5. Evaluate the model's performance:
    ```python
    mse_svr = mean_squared
    
    _error(y_test, y_pred_svr)
    r2_svr = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_svr)
    ```

## Step 3: Model Comparison

After training and evaluating the models, we can compare their performance. Use the mean squared error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-squared) to assess the models' performance:

```python
model_names = ['Linear Regression', 'Random Forest Regression', 'Support Vector Regression']
mse_scores = [mse_lr, mse_rf, mse_svr]
r2_scores = [r2_lr, r2_rf, r2_svr]

comparison_df = pd.DataFrame({'Model': model_names, 'MSE': mse_scores, 'R-squared': r2_scores})
print(comparison_df)
```

The comparison table will display the MSE and R-squared values for each model, allowing you to identify the best-performing model.

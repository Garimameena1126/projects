To provide email notifications for follow-up tasks, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Set Up an Email Service

1. Choose an email service provider (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, Mailgun) that you will use to send email notifications. Sign up for an account if you don't have one already.
2. Obtain the necessary credentials (e.g., API key, SMTP settings) from the email service provider to authenticate and send emails from your application.

#### Step 2: Configure Email Settings in Your Application

1. Open the configuration file or settings module of your application where you store application-wide settings.
2. Add the email service provider's credentials to the configuration file, such as the API key or SMTP settings. Make sure to securely store sensitive information and avoid hardcoding them in your code.
3. Provide configuration options for email templates, including the subject line, sender name, and email content. You can either store the templates directly in your application code or use a template engine to dynamically generate the content.

#### Step 3: Implement Email Notification Functionality

1. In your application code, create a function or method to handle the sending of email notifications. This function will accept parameters such as the recipient's email address, subject line, and email content.
2. Utilize the email service provider's SDK or API to send the email using the provided credentials and the information from the parameters.
3. Handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the email sending process. Consider implementing retry mechanisms or error logging as needed.

Here's an example of how the code might look in a Python application using the SendGrid email service:

```python
# Example Python code for sending email notifications using SendGrid
import sendgrid
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail

def send_email_notification(recipient_email, subject, content):
    sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(api_key='YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY')
    from_email = 'yourname@example.com'
    to_email = recipient_email
    message = Mail(
        from_email=from_email,
        to_emails=to_email,
        subject=subject,
        plain_text_content=content
    )
    try:
        response = sg.send(message)
        if response.status_code == 202:
            print('Email notification sent successfully!')
    except Exception as e:
        print('An error occurred while sending the email notification:', str(e))
```

Remember to replace `'YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY'` with your actual SendGrid API key.

#### Step 4: Integrate Email Notifications with Follow-up Task Logic

1. Identify the appropriate points in your application's follow-up task logic where you want to trigger email notifications.
2. After scheduling a follow-up task or updating its status, call the `send_email_notification()` function, passing in the recipient's email address, subject line, and email content.
3. Customize the email content to include relevant details about the follow-up task, such as the lead's name, task description, and due date. You can utilize placeholders or template tags in the email template to dynamically populate this information.

#### Step 5: Test the Email Notification Functionality

To ensure that the email notification functionality works correctly, perform tests.

1. Create a follow-up task and verify that the email notification is sent to the designated recipient.
2. Check the recipient's inbox to confirm that the email is delivered and contains the expected content.
3. Verify that error handling mechanisms are triggered correctly if there are any issues with sending the email.

In this task, we will focus on formatting the API response to return the predicted sentiment label based on the customer support messages submitted by users. The API will take the user input, preprocess it, pass it to the trained model for sentiment prediction, and then format the response in a suitable manner. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Set up the Backend Server

To begin, we need to set up a backend server using a web framework of your choice. For this guide, we will use Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. Follow these steps to set up the backend server:

1. Install Flask using the following command:
    ```shell
    pip install flask
    ```

2. Create a new Python file called `app.py` and import the necessary modules:
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    ```

3. Initialize the Flask application:
    ```python
    app = Flask(__name__)
    ```

## Step 2: Create the API Endpoint

Next, we will create an API endpoint where users can submit customer support messages for sentiment analysis. Add the following code to your `app.py` file:

```python
@app.route('/sentiment', methods=['POST'])
def predict_sentiment():
    # Get the user input from the request
    user_input = request.json['message']

    # Preprocess the user input (refer to the preprocessing guide)

    # Pass the preprocessed input to the trained model for prediction (refer to the model training guide)

    # Format the API response
    response = {
        'message': user_input,
        'sentiment': predicted_sentiment
    }

    # Return the API response as JSON
    return jsonify(response)
```

## Step 3: Preprocess User Input

Before passing the user input to the trained model, we need to preprocess it to ensure consistency and remove any unnecessary elements. You can refer to the text preprocessing and feature extraction guide for detailed steps on how to preprocess the text data. Make sure to incorporate the relevant preprocessing code in the `predict_sentiment` function.

## Step 4: Pass Input to the Trained Model

Once the user input is preprocessed, we can pass it to the trained sentiment analysis model for prediction. Refer to the model training and evaluation guide for instructions on how to load the trained model and make predictions. Incorporate the necessary code within the `predict_sentiment` function.

## Step 5: Format the API Response

After obtaining the predicted sentiment label from the model, we need to format the API response to provide meaningful information to the users. In our case, we will include the original user input message and the predicted sentiment label in the response.

Modify the following code within the `predict_sentiment` function to format the response:

```python
response = {
    'message': user_input,
    'sentiment': predicted_sentiment
}
```

Feel free to customize the response format as per your project requirements.

## Step 6: Test the API Endpoint

To ensure that the API endpoint is functioning correctly, we should test it using sample customer support messages. Use the following steps to test the API functionality:

1. Start the Flask development server by running the command:
    ```shell
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open a new terminal or API testing tool like Postman.

3. Send a POST request to the API endpoint `http://localhost:5000/sentiment` with the following JSON payload:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "I'm really satisfied with the customer support I received!"
    }
    ```

4. Verify that the API response is returned successfully and contains the expected information.

## Step 7: Validate Sentiment Predictions

To validate the accuracy of the sentiment predictions made by the API, we can compare them to the true labels in the testing dataset. This step helps ensure that the API is performing correctly and providing meaningful results.

Refer to the model training and evaluation guide for instructions on how to load the testing dataset and calculate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Step 8: Document the Project Setup

Lastly, it's important to document the project setup and provide instructions for others to test the deployed API. Create a README file or a project documentation document that includes the following information:

- Instructions to install the necessary dependencies (including the web framework and any additional libraries)
- Steps to set up the backend server
- Details about the API endpoint and expected JSON payload format
- Sample API requests and responses
- Instructions to run the API locally or deploy it to a hosting platform

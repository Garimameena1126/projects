1. Select the specific third-party APIs you want to integrate to implement the desired features. For example, you might choose a payment gateway API like Stripe and a social media sharing API like ShareThis.

2. Sign up for developer accounts with the chosen third-party API providers. This will allow you to obtain the necessary credentials and access keys required to use their APIs.

3. Obtain the API credentials or access keys from each provider. These credentials typically include an API key, secret key, client ID, or client secret. Make sure to store these securely and avoid committing them to version control.

4. Install any necessary libraries or modules for interacting with the third-party APIs. Most APIs provide client libraries or SDKs for popular programming languages, which make it easier to integrate the APIs into your project. Follow the installation instructions provided in the API documentation.

5. Configure your project to use the credentials or access keys obtained from each third-party API provider. This usually involves storing the credentials securely in your project's configuration files or environment variables.

6. Implement online payment functionality using the payment gateway API. Here's an example using the Stripe API:

   - Include the Stripe library in your frontend code:

     ```html
     <script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
     ```

   - Create a payment form in your HTML file:

     ```html
     <form id="payment-form">
       <input type="text" id="card-element" placeholder="Card details" />
       <button type="submit">Pay</button>
     </form>
     ```

   - Initialize the Stripe client and handle the payment form submission:

     ```javascript
     // Initialize Stripe with your public API key
     const stripe = Stripe('YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLIC_API_KEY');

     // Create an instance of Elements
     const elements = stripe.elements();
     const cardElement = elements.create('card');

     // Mount the card element to the DOM
     cardElement.mount('#card-element');

     // Handle the payment form submission
     const paymentForm = document.getElementById('payment-form');
     paymentForm.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
       event.preventDefault();

       const { error, paymentMethod } = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({
         type: 'card',
         card: cardElement,
       });

       if (error) {
         console.error('Error creating payment method:', error);
       } else {
         // Send the paymentMethod.id to your backend for processing the payment
         console.log('Payment method:', paymentMethod);
       }
     });
     ```

   Customize the code according to the specific payment gateway API you're integrating and the desired payment flow.

7. Implement social sharing functionality using the social media sharing API. Here's an example using the ShareThis API:

   - Include the ShareThis library in your frontend code:

     ```html
     <script async src="https://platform-api.sharethis.com/js/sharethis.js#property=YOUR_PROPERTY_ID&product=YOUR_PRODUCT_ID"></script>
     ```

   - Add social media sharing buttons to your HTML file:

     ```html
     <div class="share-buttons">
       <button class="share-facebook">Share on Facebook</button>
       <button class="share-twitter">Share on Twitter</button>
     </div>
     ```

   - Initialize the ShareThis functionality and attach event listeners to the sharing buttons:

     ```javascript
     // Initialize ShareThis with your property and product IDs
     sharethis.initialize('YOUR_PROPERTY_ID', 'YOUR_PRODUCT_ID');

     // Attach

 event listeners to the sharing buttons
     const facebookButton = document.querySelector('.share-facebook');
     facebookButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
       sharethis.share('facebook', 'URL_TO_SHARE');
     });

     const twitterButton = document.querySelector('.share-twitter');
     twitterButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
       sharethis.share('twitter', 'URL_TO_SHARE');
     });
     ```

   Customize the code according to the specific social media sharing API you're integrating and the desired sharing options.

8. Test the implemented features by running your project and interacting with the payment and sharing functionalities. Verify that payments are processed correctly and that wishlists can be shared to social media platforms.

9. Handle any necessary error scenarios and edge cases. Ensure that your code gracefully handles situations such as payment failures, API errors, and unsupported social media platforms.

10. Consider implementing additional security measures if required by the third-party APIs or to protect user data. This may involve encrypting sensitive data, validating API responses, or implementing user authentication mechanisms.

11. Document the integration details, including any limitations, dependencies, or considerations specific to the third-party APIs, for future reference and maintenance.

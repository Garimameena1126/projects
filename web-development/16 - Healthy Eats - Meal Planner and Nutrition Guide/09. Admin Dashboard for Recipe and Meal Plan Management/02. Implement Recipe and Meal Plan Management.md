
## Develop Functionality for Administrators

In this task, we will focus on implementing the functionality that allows administrators to add, edit, and delete recipes and meal plans through the administrative interface.

### Step 1: Add Functionality to Add Recipes

1. Design the user interface: Create a form in the administrative interface with input fields for the recipe details, such as title, ingredients, and instructions. Include a "Submit" button to submit the form.
2. Implement the backend API endpoint: Create an API endpoint that handles the addition of recipes. This endpoint should receive the recipe data, validate it, and store it in the database.
3. Connect the frontend and backend: Use JavaScript or a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) to handle the form submission. Send an HTTP POST request to the backend API endpoint with the recipe data when the form is submitted.
4. Validate the data: On the server-side, validate the submitted recipe data to ensure it meets the required criteria. Check for required fields, data types, and any other specific validation rules.
5. Store the recipe in the database: If the data passes validation, save the recipe in the database, associating it with the administrator's account or any relevant information.
6. Provide feedback to the administrator: Display a success message or redirect the administrator to the recipe listing page after the recipe is successfully added.

Example (Backend API Endpoint in Node.js with Express):

```javascript
// Import necessary modules and dependencies
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Define route to handle recipe creation
router.post('/recipes', (req, res) => {
  // Extract recipe data from request body
  const { title, ingredients, instructions } = req.body;

  // Validate the data (e.g., check for required fields)
  if (!title || !ingredients || !instructions) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });
  }

  // Create a new recipe in the database
  const newRecipe = Recipe.create({
    title,
    ingredients,
    instructions,
    // Add any additional fields or associations as needed
  });

  // Provide a success response
  return res.status(201).json({ message: 'Recipe added successfully' });
});

// Export the router
module.exports = router;
```

### Step 2: Implement Functionality to Edit Recipes

1. Design the user interface: Create a form in the administrative interface pre-filled with the existing recipe details. Allow administrators to modify any desired fields.
2. Implement the backend API endpoint: Create an API endpoint that handles the editing of recipes. This endpoint should receive the modified recipe data, validate it, and update the corresponding record in the database.
3. Connect the frontend and backend: Use JavaScript or a frontend framework to handle the form submission. Send an HTTP PUT or PATCH request to the backend API endpoint with the modified recipe data when the form is submitted.
4. Validate the data: On the server-side, validate the modified recipe data to ensure it meets the required criteria. Check for required fields, data types, and any other specific validation rules.
5. Update the recipe in the database: If the data passes validation, update the corresponding recipe record in the database with the modified data.
6. Provide feedback to the administrator: Display a success message or redirect the administrator to the recipe listing page after the recipe is successfully edited.

Example (Backend API Endpoint in Node.js with Express):

```javascript
// Import necessary modules and dependencies
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Define route to handle recipe updates


router.put('/recipes/:id', (req, res) => {
  // Extract recipe data from request body
  const { title, ingredients, instructions } = req.body;
  const { id } = req.params;

  // Validate the data (e.g., check for required fields)
  if (!title || !ingredients || !instructions) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing required fields' });
  }

  // Update the recipe in the database
  Recipe.updateOne({ _id: id }, { title, ingredients, instructions })
    .then(() => {
      // Provide a success response
      return res.status(200).json({ message: 'Recipe updated successfully' });
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      // Handle any errors
      return res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while updating the recipe' });
    });
});

// Export the router
module.exports = router;
```

### Step 3: Implement Functionality to Delete Recipes

1. Design the user interface: Display the list of recipes in the administrative interface along with a "Delete" button for each recipe.
2. Implement the backend API endpoint: Create an API endpoint that handles the deletion of recipes. This endpoint should receive the recipe ID, validate it, and remove the corresponding record from the database.
3. Connect the frontend and backend: Use JavaScript or a frontend framework to handle the "Delete" button click event. Send an HTTP DELETE request to the backend API endpoint with the recipe ID when the button is clicked.
4. Validate the data: On the server-side, validate the recipe ID to ensure it exists and is associated with the administrator's account.
5. Delete the recipe from the database: If the data passes validation, remove the corresponding recipe record from the database.
6. Provide feedback to the administrator: Display a success message or update the recipe listing page to reflect the deletion.

Example (Backend API Endpoint in Node.js with Express):

```javascript
// Import necessary modules and dependencies
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Define route to handle recipe deletion
router.delete('/recipes/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;

  // Validate the recipe ID (e.g., check if it exists)

  // Delete the recipe from the database
  Recipe.deleteOne({ _id: id })
    .then(() => {
      // Provide a success response
      return res.status(200).json({ message: 'Recipe deleted successfully' });
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      // Handle any errors
      return res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while deleting the recipe' });
    });
});

// Export the router
module.exports = router;
```

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented the functionality for administrators to add, edit, and delete recipes and meal plans through the administrative interface. This will greatly enhance the management capabilities of the admin dashboard.

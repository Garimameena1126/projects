# Extending Database Schema for Supplier Management

In this task, we will extend the existing database schema to include supplier-related information. This will allow us to store and retrieve supplier data in our application.

## Step 1: Identify Supplier Data

1. Determine the supplier-related information that needs to be stored in the database. This may include fields such as supplier name, contact information, address, and any other relevant details.

2. Decide on the appropriate data types for each field based on the requirements of your application. For example, the supplier name may be stored as a string, while the contact information could be stored as separate fields for phone number and email.

## Step 2: Modify Database Schema

1. Access your database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and open the database associated with your application.

2. Locate the table or tables related to product information in the database schema. These tables may already exist if you have implemented product management functionality.

3. Add a new table to the schema to store supplier information. Define the necessary columns for the supplier-related fields identified in Step 1.

Example schema modification (SQL syntax for creating a new table):

```sql
CREATE TABLE suppliers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  contact_name VARCHAR(255),
  phone_number VARCHAR(20),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  address VARCHAR(255)
);
```

4. Define any relationships between the new supplier table and existing product-related tables, if applicable. For example, you may establish a foreign key constraint between the `suppliers` table and the `products` table to associate each product with its respective supplier.

Example schema modification (SQL syntax for adding a foreign key constraint):

```sql
ALTER TABLE products
ADD COLUMN supplier_id INT,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (supplier_id) REFERENCES suppliers(id);
```

5. Apply the schema modifications to the database to create the new table and update any related tables.

## Step 3: Update Backend Logic

1. Navigate to the backend codebase and locate the files or modules responsible for interacting with the database.

2. Update the data models or classes to include the new supplier-related fields.

Example (JavaScript/Node.js data model for a supplier):

```javascript
class Supplier {
  constructor(id, name, contactName, phoneNumber, email, address) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.contactName = contactName;
    this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
    this.email = email;
    this.address = address;
  }
}
```

3. Modify the database access functions or methods to handle the new supplier-related operations, such as creating, updating, and retrieving supplier data.

Example (JavaScript/Node.js function for creating a new supplier):

```javascript
const createSupplier = (supplierData) => {
  // Insert supplier data into the database
  // ...
};
```

4. Update any existing functionality that interacts with product data to incorporate the supplier-related information. For example, when retrieving a product, you may also need to retrieve the associated supplier details.

## Step 4: Test and Verify

1. Start your backend server and any necessary database services.

2. Interact with the backend API endpoints or functionality related to supplier management to create, update, and retrieve supplier data.

3. Verify that the new supplier-related fields are being stored and retrieved correctly from the database.

4. Test any existing functionality that relies on the supplier information, such as displaying supplier details for products.

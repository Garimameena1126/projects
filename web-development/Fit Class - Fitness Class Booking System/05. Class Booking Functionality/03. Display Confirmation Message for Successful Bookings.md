#  Displaying a Confirmation Message upon Successful Class Booking

In this guide, we will learn how to display a confirmation message to users upon successful class booking in the fitness class booking system. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to implement this functionality in your web application.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have completed the following tasks:
- Set up the project and initialized a Git repository.
- Designed the user interface with the necessary pages, including the booking functionality.
- Implemented the class booking system that tracks available spots.

## Step 1: Identify the Successful Booking Event
1. Open the file responsible for handling class bookings. For example, if you have a `booking.js` file in your project's `src` directory, open it in your code editor.

2. Locate the section of code where the booking process is completed successfully. This could be within a function or route that handles the booking request and updates the database.

3. Identify the point in the code where you determine that the booking was successful. This could be a condition that checks if the booking was saved to the database without any errors. For example:
    ```javascript
    if (bookingSavedSuccessfully) {
      // Display confirmation message
    } else {
      // Handle booking error
    }
    ```

## Step 2: Display the Confirmation Message
1. Determine where you want to display the confirmation message in your user interface. This could be on the same page where the user initiated the booking process or a separate page.

2. Locate the HTML element or section where the confirmation message will be rendered. You can use an existing element or create a new one specifically for displaying the message.

3. Add the necessary code to display the confirmation message dynamically. You can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and update the content of the HTML element. For example:
    ```html
    <div id="confirmationMessage"></div>
    ```
    ```javascript
    if (bookingSavedSuccessfully) {
      const confirmationMessageElement = document.getElementById('confirmationMessage');
      confirmationMessageElement.textContent = 'Booking successful! Your spot has been reserved.';
    }
    ```

4. Customize the appearance and styling of the confirmation message using CSS. You can define styles for the element's ID or class to make it stand out and provide visual feedback to the user.

## Step 3: Test the Functionality
1. Start your web application locally by running the appropriate command. For example, if you're using Node.js with Express, you can use the command `node app.js` or `npm start` depending on your setup.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the page where you can initiate a class booking.

3. Complete the booking process by selecting a class and submitting the form.

4. Verify that the confirmation message is displayed upon successful booking. If the booking fails, ensure that the appropriate error handling is triggered instead.

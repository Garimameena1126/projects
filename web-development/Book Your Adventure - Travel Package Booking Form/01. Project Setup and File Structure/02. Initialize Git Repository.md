1. Open your preferred terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project folder you created earlier. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

   ```shell
   cd path/to/project-folder
   ```

   Replace `path/to/project-folder` with the actual path to your project folder.

3. Once you are inside the project folder, run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:

   ```shell
   git init
   ```

   This command initializes a new Git repository in your project folder, creating a hidden `.git` directory that will contain all the necessary files for version control.

4. Verify that the repository has been successfully initialized by running the following command:

   ```shell
   git status
   ```

   You should see a message indicating that you are on the main branch and there are no commits yet.

   ```
   On branch main

   No commits yet

   nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
   ```

5. At this point, you have successfully initialized a new Git repository for your project. Git is now ready to track changes in your project files.

   Note: It's a good practice to create a `.gitignore` file in the project root directory to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git. For example, you can exclude IDE-specific files, build artifacts, and sensitive information. This helps keep your repository clean and prevents unintended commits. You can create a `.gitignore` file manually or use pre-defined templates for specific programming languages or frameworks.

6. To stage and commit your existing project files, follow these steps:

   a. Run the following command to stage all the changes in your project:

      ```shell
      git add .
      ```

      This command adds all the files and directories in the current directory to the staging area.

   b. Run the following command to commit the changes:

      ```shell
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
      ```

      Replace `"Initial commit"` with a meaningful message that describes the initial state of your project. This message will help you understand the purpose of the commit in the future.

Congratulations! You have successfully initialized a new Git repository and made your initial commit. Your project is now under version control, and you can continue to track changes and collaborate with others using Git.

# Regression Model Selection in Flight Forecast - Flight Price Prediction

In this guide, we will explore the task of regression model selection for Flight Forecast - Flight Price Prediction. Regression models are used to predict numerical values based on input features. The goal of model selection is to identify the most suitable regression model for the given task. We will cover the steps involved in model selection and training, ensuring that beginners can easily understand and follow along.

## Step 1: Understanding the Problem

Before we dive into the model selection process, let's first gain a clear understanding of the problem at hand. Flight Forecast - Flight Price Prediction aims to predict the prices of flights based on various factors such as departure time, destination, airline, and more. We will use a regression approach to tackle this problem, as we want to predict continuous numerical values (flight prices).

## Step 2: Data Preparation

To build and train our regression models, we need a dataset that contains relevant features and the corresponding flight prices. Ensure that you have a well-prepared dataset with the following characteristics:

- **Features**: Each row in the dataset should represent a flight, with various features such as departure time, destination, airline, etc. These features will serve as inputs for our regression models.
- **Target Variable**: The dataset should include the actual flight prices as the target variable. This will be the value we aim to predict using our regression models.

Make sure the dataset is properly cleaned, removing any missing values or outliers that could affect the performance of our models.

## Step 3: Splitting the Dataset

Before proceeding with model selection, we need to split our dataset into two subsets: the training set and the testing set. The training set will be used to train our regression models, while the testing set will be used to evaluate their performance.

It is common to use a 70-30 or 80-20 split, where 70% or 80% of the data is used for training and the remaining 30% or 20% is used for testing. This ensures that we have enough data for training while also having sufficient samples for evaluating the models.

In Python, you can use the scikit-learn library to perform the dataset split. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

## Step 4: Selecting Regression Models

Now that we have our training and testing sets ready, we can move on to selecting regression models for our Flight Forecast - Flight Price Prediction task. There are several regression models to choose from, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression, among others.

To determine the most suitable model for our task, we can employ techniques such as cross-validation and performance evaluation metrics. These techniques help us understand how well a model performs and how it generalizes to unseen data.

Here's an example of using cross-validation with Linear Regression in Python:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Create a Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Perform cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)

# Print the mean score across all cross-validation folds
print("Mean R^2 Score:", scores.mean())
```

By using different regression models and evaluating their performance, we can choose the model that achieves the best results for our Flight Price Prediction task.

## Step 5: Training and Evaluating the Selected Model

Once we have selected the most suitable regression model, it's time to train

it on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set. This step helps us understand how well our chosen model generalizes to unseen data.

Using the selected model, here's an example of how to train and evaluate it in Python:

```python
# Train the selected model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the testing set
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print("R^2 Score:", score)
```

The R^2 score is a commonly used metric to evaluate regression models. It indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that can be explained by the model. The closer the R^2 score is to 1, the better the model's performance.

## Step 6: Fine-tuning the Model

In some cases, we might want to fine-tune our selected model to further improve its performance. This process involves adjusting hyperparameters, which are settings that are not learned from the data but rather set manually.

For example, in a Random Forest regression model, we can adjust parameters such as the number of trees, the maximum depth of each tree, and the number of features to consider when looking for the best split.

To fine-tune the model, we can use techniques like grid search or random search. These techniques involve systematically exploring different combinations of hyperparameters to find the optimal configuration.

Here's an example of using grid search with Random Forest regression in Python:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Create a Random Forest regressor
model = RandomForestRegressor()

# Define the hyperparameters to search
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 5, 10]
}

# Perform grid search
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get the best hyperparameter configuration
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
print("Best Hyperparameters:", best_params)
```

By fine-tuning our selected model, we can potentially achieve better performance and more accurate flight price predictions.

## Step 7: Model Deployment and Prediction

After finalizing our regression model and achieving satisfactory performance, we can deploy the model to make flight price predictions on new, unseen data. This can be done by using the trained model to predict flight prices based on input features.

Here's an example of how to make predictions using the trained model in Python:

```python
# Predict flight prices using the trained model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare the predicted prices with the actual prices
for i in range(len(predictions)):
    print("Predicted Price:", predictions[i], "Actual Price:", y_test[i])
```

Make sure to preprocess the input features of the new data in the same way as the training data to ensure consistency.

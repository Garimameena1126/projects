
## Create the Basic Structure of the Form using HTML

1. Open your text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2. Navigate to the project folder where you want to create the booking form.

3. Create a new HTML file. You can name it `index.html` or choose any other suitable name.

4. Open the HTML file in your text editor or IDE.

5. Start by adding the HTML doctype declaration at the beginning of the file. This tells the browser that the file is an HTML document. Add the following code:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   ```

6. Inside the HTML document, add the `<html>` tags to enclose the entire content of the file. The opening tag should be placed below the doctype declaration, and the closing tag should be added at the end of the file. Add the following code:

   ```html
   <html>
   </html>
   ```

7. Within the `<html>` tags, add the `<head>` section. This section contains metadata and other information about the web page. Add the following code:

   ```html
   <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     <title>Booking Form</title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   ```

   - The `<meta>` tags specify the character encoding and viewport settings for the web page.
   - The `<title>` tag sets the title of the web page, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
   - The `<link>` tag links the CSS file (`styles.css`) to the HTML file. Make sure to replace `"styles.css"` with the correct path to your CSS file if it's located in a different directory.

8. After the `<head>` section, add the `<body>` section. This section contains the visible content of the web page. Add the following code:

   ```html
   <body>
     <h1>Booking Form</h1>
     <form>
       <!-- Form fields will be added here -->
     </form>
   </body>
   ```

   - The `<h1>` tag creates a heading with the text "Booking Form". You can modify the text or use a different heading level (e.g., `<h2>`, `<h3>`) as per your design preference.
   - The `<form>` tag creates the form element that will contain the form fields.

9. Inside the `<form>` element, add the necessary form fields based on your requirements. For example, you can add fields for name, email, phone, and destination. Use appropriate form field elements like `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>` as needed. Here's an example of adding an input field for the name:

   ```html
   <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
   ```

   - The `<input>` tag is used to create an input field.
   - The `type` attribute specifies the type of input field. In this case, it's set to `"text"` to create a text input field.
   - The `name` attribute assigns a name to the input field, which is used to identify the field when processing the form data.
   - The `placeholder` attribute sets a placeholder text that appears inside the input field as a hint for the user.
   - The `required` attribute makes the input field required, meaning the user must enter a value before submitting the form.

10. Continue adding the remaining form fields based on your requirements.

11. Save the `index.html` file.

Congratulations! You have successfully created the basic structure of the form using HTML. You can now proceed to style the form using CSS, validate the form inputs, and add any additional functionality you need.

Remember to save your changes regularly and test the form in the browser to ensure it appears correctly and functions as intended.

Keep in mind that the example provided is for a basic form structure. You can customize it further by adding labels, additional form elements, and any other desired features to meet your specific project requirements.

### 1. Open File Explorer or Terminal
Open your preferred file explorer or terminal application. This will allow you to navigate and create directories to set up the project's directory structure.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Folder
Using the file explorer or the `cd` command in the terminal, navigate to the project folder you created in the previous step. This is where you will set up the directory structure.

### 3. Create a Source Code Directory
In this step, you will create a directory to hold the source code of your project. This is where you will write your application's code files.

Create a directory named `src` (short for "source") inside your project folder. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting "New Folder" (or equivalent) or by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
mkdir src
```

### 4. Organize Subdirectories
To further organize your project, you can create subdirectories within the `src` directory to separate different types of files or components. The specific subdirectories you create may vary depending on the project's requirements, but here are some common ones:

- **Components**: If you are building a web application, you might create a directory named `components` to store reusable UI components.
    ```bash
    mkdir src/components
    ```

- **Pages**: If your project has multiple pages, you can create a directory named `pages` to store the individual page components or templates.
    ```bash
    mkdir src/pages
    ```

- **Styles**: For storing CSS or other styling files, you can create a directory named `styles`.
    ```bash
    mkdir src/styles
    ```

- **Assets**: If your project requires additional static assets such as images, fonts, or videos, you can create a directory named `assets`.
    ```bash
    mkdir src/assets
    ```

Feel free to create additional subdirectories as needed for your project.

### 5. Create Additional Directories
Apart from the `src` directory, you may need to create other directories based on the project's requirements. Here are some commonly used directories:

- **Tests**: If you plan to write automated tests for your code, create a directory named `tests` to hold the test files.
    ```bash
    mkdir tests
    ```

- **Documentation**: If you want to maintain documentation for your project, create a directory named `docs`.
    ```bash
    mkdir docs
    ```

- **Configuration**: For storing configuration files, create a directory named `config`.
    ```bash
    mkdir config
    ```

Again, the specific directories you create may vary depending on your project's needs.

### 6. Verify the Directory Structure
After creating the necessary directories, you can verify the project's directory structure by examining the contents of your project folder. It should resemble the following structure:

```
project-folder
├── src
│   ├── components
│   ├── pages
│   ├── styles
│   └── assets
├── tests
├── docs
└── config
```

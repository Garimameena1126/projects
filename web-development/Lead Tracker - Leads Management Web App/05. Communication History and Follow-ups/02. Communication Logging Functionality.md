To log communication details for each lead, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Design the Communication Log Data Structure

Determine the data structure to store communication details for each lead. Identify the necessary fields such as lead ID, date and time of communication, communication type, and message content.

Here's an example of how the communication log data structure might look:

| Field Name   | Data Type    | Description                                   |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| id           | INTEGER      | Unique identifier for each communication entry |
| lead_id      | INTEGER      | Foreign key referencing the lead table         |
| date_time    | DATETIME     | Date and time of the communication             |
| type         | VARCHAR(50)  | Type of communication (e.g., call, email)      |
| content      | TEXT         | Content of the communication                   |

#### Step 2: Modify the Lead Table Schema

If you already have a lead table in your database, modify its schema to include a relationship with the communication log table.

Add a foreign key column in the lead table that references the communication log table.

Here's an example of how the SQL statement might look to modify the lead table schema:

```sql
ALTER TABLE leads
ADD COLUMN communication_log_id INTEGER,
ADD FOREIGN KEY (communication_log_id) REFERENCES communication_log(id);
```

Adjust the SQL statement based on your database system and table structure.

#### Step 3: Create the Communication Log Table

Using a database management tool (e.g., SQL command-line interface, database GUI tool, ORM), execute the necessary SQL command to create the communication log table.

Here's an example of how the SQL command might look:

```sql
CREATE TABLE communication_log (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  lead_id INTEGER,
  date_time DATETIME,
  type VARCHAR(50),
  content TEXT
);
```

Adjust the SQL statement based on your database system and any additional requirements.

#### Step 4: Update the Application Code

Update your application code to implement the functionality for logging communication details.

When a communication occurs for a lead, capture the relevant information (e.g., lead ID, date and time, communication type, content) and insert a new row into the communication log table.

Here's an example of how the code might look in a server-side language like Python using SQL queries:

```python
# Example Python code for logging communication details
import sqlite3

def log_communication(lead_id, date_time, communication_type, content):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    query = '''
        INSERT INTO communication_log (lead_id, date_time, type, content)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
    '''
    cursor.execute(query, (lead_id, date_time, communication_type, content))
    conn.commit()

    conn.close()
```

Adjust the code based on your chosen programming language, database system, and any specific frameworks or libraries you're using.

#### Step 5: Test the Communication Logging Functionality

To ensure that the communication logging functionality works correctly, perform tests.

Simulate different communication scenarios for leads and verify that the communication details are logged correctly in the communication log table.

You can retrieve and display the communication log entries for a specific lead to verify the functionality.

# Step-by-Step Guide: Implement JavaScript Functionality to Capture Form Data on Submission

In this task, we will implement JavaScript functionality to capture the form data when it is submitted by the user. We will use JavaScript to handle the form submission event, retrieve the input values, and store them in an array or object. Follow the step-by-step guide below to implement this feature.

## Prerequisites

- HTML knowledge
- JavaScript basics
- Code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed

## Steps

1. **Open Code Editor**

   Launch your preferred code editor or IDE.

2. **Open the HTML File**

   Open the `index.html` file that contains the exercise logging form in your code editor.

3. **Add an ID to the Form**

   Locate the `<form>` element in the HTML file and add an `id` attribute to it. This will allow us to easily reference the form in JavaScript.

   ```html
   <form id="exercise-form">
     <!-- Form fields -->
     <!-- Submit button -->
   </form>
   ```

4. **Create a JavaScript Function to Handle Form Submission**

   In the `<script>` tag, create a JavaScript function called `handleFormSubmission()` that will be responsible for capturing the form data when it is submitted.

   ```html
   <script>
     function handleFormSubmission(event) {
       // Prevent the default form submission behavior
       event.preventDefault();

       // Retrieve the form input values
       const exerciseNameInput = document.getElementById('exercise-name');
       const setsInput = document.getElementById('sets');
       const repsInput = document.getElementById('reps');

       const exerciseName = exerciseNameInput.value;
       const sets = setsInput.value;
       const reps = repsInput.value;

       // Do something with the form data (e.g., store in an array or object)
       // ...
     }
   </script>
   ```

   In this example, the function `handleFormSubmission()` is triggered when the form is submitted. It prevents the default form submission behavior, retrieves the values of the exercise name, sets, and reps inputs, and assigns them to variables.

5. **Add Event Listener to the Form**

   Still in the `<script>` tag, add the following code snippet to attach an event listener to the form and call the `handleFormSubmission()` function when it is submitted.

   ```html
   <script>
     // Existing code

     const exerciseForm = document.getElementById('exercise-form');
     exerciseForm.addEventListener('submit', handleFormSubmission);
   </script>
   ```

   This code snippet selects the form element using its ID and adds an event listener for the `'submit'` event. When the form is submitted, the `handleFormSubmission()` function will be called.

6. **Test the Application**

   Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Fill in the exercise logging form with some values and submit it. Verify that the form submission does not result in a page reload. You can use `console.log()` statements inside the `handleFormSubmission()` function to output the captured form data and ensure it is working as expected.

7. **Summary**

   Congratulations! You have successfully implemented JavaScript functionality to capture form data on submission. The `handleFormSubmission()` function retrieves the input values from the form and allows you to perform further actions, such as storing the data in an array or object.

   Remember to save your files and keep a backup of your code before proceeding to the next task.

Adding authorization checks ensures that only authenticated users can access certain actions or resources within your application. Follow the steps below to implement authorization checks in your project.

1. Define User Roles and Permissions
   - Identify the roles or user types in your application. Examples may include "admin," "user," or "guest."
   - Determine the specific permissions or actions associated with each role. For instance, an admin might have permissions to delete users or manage settings, while a regular user may only be able to view their own profile.
   - Document the roles and their associated permissions for reference throughout the implementation.

2. Implement Authentication
   - Ensure you have implemented user authentication using a secure method, such as session-based authentication or JWT authentication, as described in the previous tasks.
   - Make sure that you can identify the authenticated user when processing requests.

3. Include Authorization Middleware
   - Identify the middleware or request interceptor mechanism provided by your application framework.
   - Create a middleware function or interceptor that intercepts incoming requests before they reach the target handler.
   - Within the middleware, retrieve the authenticated user's information and check their role or permissions against the required authorization for the requested action.
   - If the user has the necessary authorization, allow the request to proceed to the intended handler. Otherwise, return an error response or redirect the user to an appropriate page.

4. Apply Authorization Checks
   - Identify the actions or resources within your application that should be restricted to authenticated users.
   - In each corresponding route or controller handler, apply the authorization middleware or interceptor you created in the previous step.
   - Ensure that only authenticated users with the correct role or permissions can access these restricted actions or resources.
   - Handle authorization failures by returning an error response or redirecting the user to a suitable page, indicating that they are not authorized to perform the requested action.

5. Test the Authorization
   - Test your implementation by accessing the restricted actions or resources with different user roles or permissions.
   - Verify that authenticated users with the appropriate authorization can access the restricted features, while unauthorized users receive the expected error response or redirection.
   - Adjust your authorization checks and error handling as necessary to ensure proper access control.

# Installing Dependencies for the Project

In this guide, we will walk through the process of installing the necessary dependencies for your fitness class booking system web development project. The dependencies we will install include Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to install these dependencies.

## Step 1: Open the Project Folder
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project folder you created and initialized the Git repository in. For example, if your project folder is named "fitness-class-booking-system," use the following command:
    ```bash
    cd fitness-class-booking-system
    ```

## Step 2: Create and Configure the `package.json` File
1. Initialize the project with a `package.json` file by running the following command:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```
   This command will create a default `package.json` file with default values for your project.

2. Verify that the `package.json` file has been successfully created by checking for its presence in the project folder. You can list the files using the following command:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
   Ensure that you see the `package.json` file listed.

## Step 3: Install Express
1. Install Express as a dependency by executing the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```
   This command will download and install Express from the npm registry.

2. Verify that Express has been successfully installed by checking for the presence of the `node_modules` folder in the project directory. Use the following command:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
   Ensure that you see the `node_modules` folder listed.

## Step 4: Install MongoDB and Mongoose
1. Install MongoDB and Mongoose as project dependencies by running the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install mongodb mongoose
    ```
   This command will download and install both MongoDB and Mongoose from the npm registry.

2. Verify that MongoDB and Mongoose have been successfully installed by checking the `node_modules` folder for their presence. Use the following command:
    ```bash
    ls node_modules
    ```
   Ensure that you see both the `mongodb` and `mongoose` folders listed.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the necessary dependencies for your fitness class booking system project.

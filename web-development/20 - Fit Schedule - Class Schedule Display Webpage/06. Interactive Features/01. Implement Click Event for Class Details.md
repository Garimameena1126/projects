#### Task: Implement a feature that allows users to click on a class name or timing to view additional details.

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) that you created earlier in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Locate the section of the HTML file where the class names and timings are displayed. This section should be within the container element you created earlier.
   - For example, if you used a `<div>` element with an `id` attribute for the container, you can find it as `<div id="class-schedule-container">` or similar.
3. Wrap each class name and timing element with a clickable element, such as an `<a>` tag, to make it interactive. Add an appropriate class or identifier to each clickable element for easy access from JavaScript. For instance:

```html
<div id="class-schedule-container">
  <a class="class-details" href="#">Class Name 1</a>
  <p class="class-timing">9:00 AM - 10:00 AM</p>
  <a class="class-details" href="#">Class Name 2</a>
  <p class="class-timing">10:30 AM - 11:30 AM</p>
  <!-- More class names and timings -->
</div>
```

Explanation:
- In this example, we have used `<a>` tags with the class "class-details" to make the class names interactive.
- We have also given the same class name to each clickable element to select them easily using JavaScript later on.
- The `href="#"` attribute is used to provide a clickable behavior, but we will prevent the default link behavior using JavaScript.

4. Save the changes made to the HTML file.

Now, let's move on to implementing the JavaScript functionality to handle the click event and toggle the visibility of additional details.

5. Create a new JavaScript file and save it as `script.js` in the same directory as the HTML file.
6. Link the `script.js` file to the HTML file by adding the following code just before the closing `</body>` tag in the HTML file:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

7. Open the `script.js` file in the text editor or IDE.
8. Begin by adding the following JavaScript code to select the clickable elements and add an event listener to each of them:

```javascript
// Get all the clickable elements with class "class-details"
const classDetailsLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.class-details');

// Attach a click event listener to each clickable element
classDetailsLinks.forEach(link => {
  link.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default link behavior
    
    // Handle the click event here
  });
});
```

Explanation:
- The `document.querySelectorAll('.class-details')` method selects all elements with the class "class-details" and returns a NodeList.
- The `forEach()` method is used to loop through each clickable element in the NodeList.
- Within the loop, the `addEventListener()` method is used to attach a click event listener to each clickable element.
- The `event.preventDefault()` method is called to prevent the default link behavior (e.g., navigating to a new page).

9. Now, inside the event listener, you can add code to toggle the visibility of additional details when a clickable element is clicked. You can use various approaches like modifying the CSS display property or adding/removing CSS classes. Here's an example using the CSS display property:

```javascript
// Handle the click event
link.addEventListener('click',

 function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  // Toggle the visibility of the additional details
  const detailsElement = link.nextElementSibling;
  if (detailsElement.style.display === 'none') {
    detailsElement.style.display = 'block';
  } else {
    detailsElement.style.display = 'none';
  }
});
```

Explanation:
- In this example, we assume that the additional details for each class are placed right after the clickable element in the HTML structure.
- The `link.nextElementSibling` property returns the next sibling element after the clicked link element.
- We check the current display style of the next sibling element and toggle it between "block" and "none" to show/hide the details.

10. Save the changes made to the `script.js` file.

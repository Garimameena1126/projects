
## Enable Filtering or Sorting of Projects and Tasks

In this guide, we will enhance our project management app by adding JavaScript functionality to filter or sort projects and tasks based on different criteria, such as status, due date, or priority.

### Step 1: Set up the HTML Structure

Ensure you have already created the static HTML page to display the list of existing projects and tasks, as outlined in the previous guides. Make sure the necessary HTML elements, such as buttons or select dropdowns for filtering and sorting, are in place.

### Step 2: Add JavaScript to the HTML Page

Inside the `<script>` tag in your HTML file, add the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Function to filter or sort projects and tasks
function filterTasks(criteria) {
  const taskList = document.getElementById('taskList');
  const tasks = Array.from(taskList.children);
  
  tasks.forEach(task => {
    // Apply the filtering or sorting logic based on the selected criteria
    
    // Example: Filter tasks based on the task's status
    if (criteria === 'completed' && !task.classList.contains('completed')) {
      task.style.display = 'none';
    } else if (criteria === 'pending' && task.classList.contains('completed')) {
      task.style.display = 'none';
    } else {
      task.style.display = 'block';
    }
    
    // Example: Sort tasks based on due date
    if (criteria === 'due-date') {
      // Implement sorting logic based on the task's due date
    }
    
    // Example: Sort tasks based on priority
    if (criteria === 'priority') {
      // Implement sorting logic based on the task's priority
    }
  });
}

// Attach the event listener to the filter or sort element
const filterSelect = document.getElementById('filterSelect');
filterSelect.addEventListener('change', function(event) {
  const selectedCriteria = event.target.value;
  filterTasks(selectedCriteria);
});
```

### Step 3: Update HTML Elements

Update your HTML file to include the necessary elements for filtering or sorting, such as a `<select>` dropdown with different criteria options and an appropriate ID attribute.

```html
<!-- Example select dropdown for filtering or sorting -->
<select id="filterSelect">
  <option value="all">All</option>
  <option value="completed">Completed</option>
  <option value="pending">Pending</option>
  <option value="due-date">Due Date</option>
  <option value="priority">Priority</option>
</select>
```

### Step 4: Test the Functionality

Save the HTML file and open it in a web browser. You should now see the filtering or sorting dropdown. Try selecting different criteria from the dropdown, and the JavaScript code will execute the corresponding filtering or sorting logic on the project and task elements.

Based on the selected criteria, tasks that match the filtering condition will be displayed, while others will be hidden. For sorting, the tasks will be rearranged based on the chosen criteria.

### Step 5: Customize the Functionality

You can customize the JavaScript code to match your specific filtering or sorting requirements. For example, you can add additional criteria options or implement more complex sorting algorithms.

Additionally, you may need to update the CSS styles to ensure the filtered or sorted tasks are displayed correctly based on their new order or visibility.

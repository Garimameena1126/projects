# Storing Submitted Reviews in a Database for Persistence

In this guide, we will focus on storing the reviews submitted through your reviews and ratings system in a database for persistence. We will use MongoDB as an example database and provide step-by-step instructions with code examples for beginners to follow.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with this guide, make sure you have already set up a server using a framework of your choice, such as Express.js, and have created a RESTful API endpoint to handle review submissions, as discussed in the previous guides.

## Step 1: Set Up MongoDB Database
To store the submitted reviews, we will use MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your machine and running.

## Step 2: Connect to MongoDB Database
To interact with the MongoDB database from your server, you need to establish a connection. This connection should be established when your server starts up.

### Example: Connecting to MongoDB using Mongoose

Install the `mongoose` package by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```
npm install mongoose
```

In your server file (`server.js` or similar), add the following code to establish a connection to MongoDB:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Connect to the MongoDB database
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/reviews', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
})
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Failed to connect to MongoDB', error);
  });
```

In this example, we are connecting to a MongoDB instance running on `localhost` with the default port `27017`. Replace `'mongodb://localhost:27017/reviews'` with the appropriate connection string for your MongoDB instance. The `reviews` in the connection string represents the name of the database where the reviews will be stored.

## Step 3: Create a Review Schema
A schema defines the structure of the data that will be stored in the database. In this step, we will create a review schema using Mongoose.

### Example: Creating a Review Schema

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define the review schema
const reviewSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  rating: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
    min: 1,
    max: 5,
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});

// Create a review model based on the schema
const Review = mongoose.model('Review', reviewSchema);
```

In this example, we define a review schema with fields such as `title`, `content`, `rating`, and `createdAt`. Adjust the schema according to your specific requirements.

## Step 4: Save Submitted Reviews to the Database
Now that we have the review schema, we can save the submitted reviews to the MongoDB database.

### Example: Saving Submitted Reviews

Update your API endpoint code to include the logic for saving reviews to the database:

```javascript
app.post('/api/reviews', (req, res) => {
  const reviewData = req.body;

  // Create a new review document using the Review model
  const review = new Review(reviewData);

  // Save the review to the database
  review.save()
    .then(() => {
      res.status(201).json({ message: 'Review saved successfully!' });
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to save review.' });


    });
});
```

In this example, we receive the review data from the request body and create a new `Review` instance using the Mongoose model. We then call the `save` method to persist the review in the database. If the review is saved successfully, we respond with a 201 (Created) status code and a success message. Otherwise, we respond with a 500 (Internal Server Error) status code and an error message.

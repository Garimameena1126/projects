# Creating the Homepage with Logo and Description

In this guide, we will create the homepage of our inventory management system. The homepage will display the company logo and a brief description to provide an introduction to the system.

## Step 1: Update HTML Structure

1. Open the `index.html` file in your text editor.
2. Locate the `<body>` element.
3. Add a new `<section>` element inside the `<body>` element to contain the homepage content:
```html
<section id="homepage">
    <!-- Content for the homepage will be added here -->
</section>
```

## Step 2: Add Company Logo

1. Obtain the company logo image file (e.g., `logo.png`) and save it in a suitable location within your project directory.
2. Go back to the `index.html` file.
3. Inside the `<section id="homepage">` element, add an `<img>` tag to display the company logo:
```html
<section id="homepage">
    <img src="path/to/logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
    <!-- Additional content for the homepage will be added here -->
</section>
```
Replace `"path/to/logo.png"` with the actual file path or URL to your company logo image.

## Step 3: Add Company Description

1. Determine the desired description for your company or inventory management system.
2. Inside the `<section id="homepage">` element, add a `<p>` tag to contain the company description:
```html
<section id="homepage">
    <img src="path/to/logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
    <p>Welcome to our inventory management system. We provide a comprehensive solution for tracking and managing your products, orders, and suppliers.</p>
    <!-- Additional content for the homepage will be added here -->
</section>
```
Replace the example description with your own text or customize it according to your project's requirements.

## Step 4: Save and Preview

1. Save the changes made to the `index.html` file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Verify that the homepage is displayed with the company logo and description.

# Creating a New Project Folder and Setting Up Files and Folders

In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating a new project folder and setting up the necessary files and folders for our web development project.

## Step 1: Choose a Project Name
Choose a suitable name for your project. This will be used as the folder name and should be descriptive and relevant to your project. For example, let's use the name "travel-agency-website".

## Step 2: Create a New Project Folder
1. Open your preferred file explorer or terminal.
2. Navigate to the location where you want to create the project folder.
3. Right-click (or use the terminal command) and select "New Folder" or use the command `mkdir travel-agency-website` to create a new folder with the chosen project name.

## Step 3: Set Up Files and Folders Structure
1. Open the newly created project folder in your file explorer or terminal.
2. Inside the project folder, create the following folders:

   - `css`: This folder will contain CSS files for styling your website.
   - `js`: This folder will contain JavaScript files for adding interactivity to your website.
   - `images`: This folder will store the images used in your website.
   - `pages`: This folder will store individual HTML files for different pages of your website.
   - `assets`: This folder can be used to store any additional assets like fonts, icons, or videos that your website may require.

   Your project folder structure should now look like this:

   ```
   travel-agency-website
   ├── css
   ├── js
   ├── images
   ├── pages
   └── assets
   ```

## Step 4: Create HTML File
1. Inside the `pages` folder, create a new file called `index.html`. This will be the main HTML file for your website's homepage.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor of your choice.

# Enhance Product Listing Page to Display Supplier Information

In this task, we will enhance the product listing page to display supplier information for each product. This will provide users with additional information about the suppliers associated with each product.

## Step 1: Update Database Schema

1. Review the existing database schema to determine how supplier information is stored and associated with products.

2. Ensure that the necessary supplier-related information is available in the database schema. This may include fields such as supplier name, contact information, and any other relevant details.

3. Modify the database schema as needed to include the required supplier-related information. For example, you can add a foreign key reference to the supplier table in the products table.

## Step 2: Fetch Supplier Information

1. Identify the API endpoint or database query that retrieves the product data for the product listing page.

2. Modify the API endpoint or query to fetch the associated supplier information along with the product data. Join the supplier table with the products table to retrieve the required fields.

3. Ensure that the supplier information is included in the response or query result, typically as an additional property or field for each product.

    Example (using Node.js and Express.js):
    
    ```javascript
    // Assuming you have an API endpoint for fetching product data
    app.get('/products', (req, res) => {
      // Fetch product data from the database
      const products = db.query('SELECT * FROM products');
    
      // Fetch supplier information along with the products
      const productsWithSupplier = products.map((product) => {
        const supplier = db.query('SELECT * FROM suppliers WHERE id = ?', product.supplierId);
        return { ...product, supplier };
      });
    
      res.json(productsWithSupplier);
    });
    ```

## Step 3: Update Frontend Components

1. Identify the component responsible for rendering the product listing page.

2. Update the component to display the additional supplier information for each product.

3. Modify the markup and styling of the component to accommodate the new supplier information. You may need to add new HTML elements or CSS classes to structure and style the supplier details.

    Example (using React):
    
    ```jsx
    const ProductList = ({ products }) => {
      return (
        <ul>
          {products.map((product) => (
            <li key={product.id}>
              <div>
                <h3>{product.name}</h3>
                <p>{product.description}</p>
                {/* Display supplier information */}
                <p>Supplier: {product.supplier.name}</p>
                <p>Contact: {product.supplier.contact}</p>
              </div>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      );
    };
    
    export default ProductList;
    ```

## Step 4: Test and Iterate

1. Test the product listing page to ensure that the supplier information is displayed correctly for each product.

2. Verify that the supplier details are retrieved from the database or API endpoint and rendered accurately in the frontend.

3. Make any necessary adjustments to the code, markup, or styling based on the testing results and user feedback.

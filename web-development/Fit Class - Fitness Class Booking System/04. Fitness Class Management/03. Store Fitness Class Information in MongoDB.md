#  Storing Fitness Class Information in MongoDB Database

In this guide, we will go through the process of storing fitness class information in a MongoDB database for your fitness class booking system. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to accomplish this task.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites met:
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- MongoDB installed and running locally or have access to a MongoDB server.

## Step 1: Install MongoDB and Mongoose
1. Ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your machine. If you haven't installed MongoDB, refer to the official MongoDB documentation (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) for installation instructions.

2. Install Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, by running the following command in your project folder:
    ```bash
    npm install mongoose
    ```

## Step 2: Create a Fitness Class Model
1. In your project directory, create a new file named `class.js` (or any other suitable name) to define the structure and behavior of the fitness class model.

2. Open the `class.js` file in your preferred code editor.

3. Import the necessary dependencies at the top of the file:
    ```javascript
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    ```

4. Define the schema for the fitness class using the Mongoose Schema class:
    ```javascript
    const classSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
      title: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
      },
      instructor: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
      },
      description: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
      },
      schedule: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
      },
      capacity: {
        type: Number,
        required: true,
      },
    });
    ```
   In this example schema, we have included fields such as `title`, `instructor`, `description`, `schedule`, and `capacity`. Modify the schema to suit your specific fitness class information.

5. Create a Mongoose model based on the defined schema:
    ```javascript
    const Class = mongoose.model('Class', classSchema);
    ```

## Step 3: Connect to MongoDB
    1. In the main file of your project (e.g., `index.js`), import Mongoose and connect to the MongoDB database using the following code snippet:
    ```javascript
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/fitness-class-booking', {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    })
      .then(() => {
        console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Failed to connect to MongoDB', error);
      });
    ```
   Make sure to modify the connection URL (`mongodb://localhost:27017/fitness-class-booking`) to match your MongoDB configuration.

## Step 4: Store Fitness Class Information
1. To store a new fitness class in the MongoDB database, you can use the following code snippet as an example:
    ```javascript
    const newClass = new Class({
      title: 'Yoga Class',
      instructor: 'John Doe',
      description: 'Join our relaxing yoga class to improve flexibility and reduce stress.',
      schedule: 'Mondays and Wednesdays, 6:00 PM - 7:00 PM',
      capacity: 20,
    });
    
    newClass.save()
      .then(() => {
        console.log('Fitness class saved successfully');
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Failed to save fitness class', error);
      });
    ```
   Modify the values for each field according to your fitness class details. You can create and save multiple instances of the `Class` model to store multiple fitness classes.

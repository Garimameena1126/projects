## Implementing an Activity Form to Capture Details

In this guide, we will focus on implementing a form to capture activity details such as the activity name, location, and time. By creating an intuitive form, users will be able to input the necessary information for adding activities to their itineraries.

### Step 1: Adding the Activity Form HTML

1. Open your HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in a text editor or IDE.
2. Identify the location in your document where you want to place the activity form.
3. Add the necessary HTML elements to create the form.

```html
<form id="activity-form">
  <h4>Add Activity</h4>
  <label for="activity-name">Activity Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="activity-name" required>
  <label for="activity-location">Location:</label>
  <input type="text" id="activity-location" required>
  <label for="activity-time">Time:</label>
  <input type="time" id="activity-time" required>
  <button type="submit">Add Activity</button>
</form>
```

In the above code, we create a form with input fields for the activity name, location, and time. The form also includes a submit button that will be used to add the activity.

### Step 2: Styling the Activity Form (Optional)

1. Open your CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) in a text editor or IDE.
2. Identify the appropriate selectors to style the activity form.
3. Add the necessary CSS rules to style the form according to your project's design.

```css
#activity-form {
  margin-top: 20px;
}

#activity-form label {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 5px;
}

#activity-form input[type="text"],
#activity-form input[type="time"] {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

#activity-form button[type="submit"] {
  background-color: #4caf50;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 15px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

The above code provides a basic example of styling the activity form. Modify the styles according to your project's design requirements.

### Step 3: Accessing the DOM Elements

1. Open your JavaScript file (e.g., `app.js`) in a text editor or IDE.
2. Identify the appropriate place in your code to access the DOM elements of the activity form.
3. Use `document.getElementById()` to access the form and its input elements.

```javascript
const activityForm = document.getElementById('activity-form');
const activityNameInput = document.getElementById('activity-name');
const activityLocationInput = document.getElementById('activity-location');
const activityTimeInput = document.getElementById('activity-time');
```

In the above code, we store references to the activity form and its input elements in separate variables.

### Step 4: Implementing the Form Submission Event Listener

1. Add an event listener to the activity form to capture the form submission event.
2. Implement a callback function that retrieves the input values from the form and performs the necessary actions.

```javascript
activityForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  const activityName = activityNameInput.value;
  const activityLocation = activityLocationInput.value;
  const activityTime = activityTimeInput.value;

  // Perform necessary actions with the captured activity details
  addActivity(activityName, activityLocation, activityTime);

  // Clear the form inputs
  activityNameInput.value = '';
  activityLocationInput.value = '';
  activityTimeInput.value = '';
});


```

In the above code, we prevent the default form submission behavior using `event.preventDefault()`. Then, we retrieve the values entered by the user in the input fields and store them in variables. Next, we can perform the necessary actions with these captured activity details. In this example, we assume there is a function `addActivity()` that handles the logic of adding the activity to the itinerary. Finally, we clear the form inputs by setting their values to an empty string.

### Step 5: Test the Activity Form

1. Save your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. Load your application in a web browser.
3. Locate the section where you added the activity form.
4. Fill in the activity details in the form fields.
5. Click the "Add Activity" button or submit the form.
6. Verify that the form submission event is captured and the activity details are accessed correctly in the callback function.
7. Perform the necessary actions with the captured activity details.

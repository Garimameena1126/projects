# Beginner's Guide: Storing User Information in a MongoDB Database

In this guide, we will cover the process of storing user information in a MongoDB database for your fitness class booking system web application. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to implement this functionality.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- MongoDB installed and running.

## Step 1: Set Up MongoDB Connection
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project, where the Node.js application is located.

3. Install the `mongoose` package, which allows you to interact with MongoDB from Node.js, by running the following command:
```bash
npm install mongoose
```

4. Create a new file named `db.js` (or any other suitable name) in your project's directory to handle the MongoDB connection.

5. Open `db.js` in your preferred code editor and require the `mongoose` module at the top of the file:
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
```

6. Create a function to establish the connection to your MongoDB database. Add the following code to `db.js`:
```javascript
const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/fitness-class-booking', {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
      useCreateIndex: true,
    });
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', error);
    process.exit(1); // Exit the application
  }
};

module.exports = connectDB;
```

7. Save the file.

## Step 2: Create a User Schema
1. In your project directory, create a new folder named `models` to store your Mongoose models.

2. Inside the `models` folder, create a new file named `User.js`.

3. Open `User.js` and require the `mongoose` module at the top of the file:
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
```

4. Define the user schema by creating a new Mongoose schema and assigning it to a constant named `userSchema`. Add the following code to `User.js`:
```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

## Step 3: Store User Information in the Database
1. Open the file where you handle user registration (e.g., `register.js`).

2. Require the `User` model and the `connectDB` function at the top of the file:
```javascript
const User = require('./models/User');
const connectDB = require('./db');
```

3. Invoke the `connectDB` function to establish the MongoDB connection:
```javascript
connectDB();
```

4. Implement the user registration logic by creating a new user instance and saving it to the database. Add the following code to handle user registration:
```javascript
const registerUser = async (name, email, password) => {
  try {
    const newUser = new User({
      name,
      email,
      password,
    });

    await newUser.save();

    console.log('User registered successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error registering user:', error);
  }
};

registerUser('John Doe', 'john@example.com', 'password123');
```
   Replace `'John Doe'`, `'john@example.com'`, and `'password123'` with the actual user information obtained from the registration form.

5. Save the file.

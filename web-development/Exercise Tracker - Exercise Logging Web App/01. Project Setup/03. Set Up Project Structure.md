## Creating Basic Project Structure

1. **Open Code Editor**

   Launch your preferred code editor or IDE.

2. **Create New Project Directory**

   If you haven't already done so, create a new project directory by following the instructions provided in the previous guide.

3. **Create Frontend and Backend Folders**

   Inside the project directory, create two main folders: one for the frontend and one for the backend. These folders will help organize the respective code for each part of the application.

   ```plaintext
   exercise-log/
   ├── frontend/
   └── backend/
   ```

4. **Create Frontend Subfolders**

   Navigate into the "frontend" folder and create the following subfolders:

   - `css`: This folder will contain the CSS stylesheets used for styling the web pages.
   - `js`: This folder will hold the JavaScript files responsible for client-side functionality.
   - `images`: This folder will store any images or media files used in the frontend.

   ```plaintext
   exercise-log/
   ├── frontend/
   │   ├── css/
   │   ├── js/
   │   └── images/
   └── backend/
   ```

5. **Create Backend Subfolders**

   Now, let's focus on the "backend" folder. Inside it, create the following subfolders:

   - `routes`: This folder will contain the route handlers responsible for handling incoming requests.
   - `controllers`: This folder will store the logic for processing requests and interacting with the database.
   - `models`: This folder will house the data models or schemas used for defining the structure of the data in the database.
   - `config`: This folder will hold any configuration files or modules required by the backend.
   - `middlewares`: This folder will contain any custom middleware functions used in the backend.
   - `utils`: This folder will store utility functions or helper modules used across the backend codebase.
   - `tests`: This folder will be used for storing test files and test suites if you choose to write tests for your backend code.

   ```plaintext
   exercise-log/
   ├── frontend/
   │   ├── css/
   │   ├── js/
   │   └── images/
   └── backend/
       ├── routes/
       ├── controllers/
       ├── models/
       ├── config/
       ├── middlewares/
       ├── utils/
       └── tests/ (optional)
   ```

6. **Congratulations!**

   You have successfully created the basic project structure with folders for the frontend and backend. This structure will help you organize your codebase and maintain a clear separation between frontend and backend concerns.

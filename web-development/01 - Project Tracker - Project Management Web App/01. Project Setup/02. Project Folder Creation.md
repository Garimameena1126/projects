In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating a new project folder for the project management app. This folder will serve as the root directory for our project.

### Step 1: Choose a Location

Before creating the project folder, decide on a suitable location on your computer where you want to store the project. This can be any directory or folder of your choice.

### Step 2: Open the Preferred Code Editor

Open your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code, to create the new project folder.

### Step 3: Create a New Folder

In your code editor, follow the steps below to create a new folder for the project:

1. Click on "File" in the menu bar and select "New Folder."
2. Give the folder a descriptive name, such as "project-management-app."

### Step 4: Choose the Location for the New Folder

When prompted, choose the location where you want to create the new project folder. Navigate to the location you selected in Step 1.

### Step 5: Verify the New Folder

After creating the new folder, ensure that it appears in the desired location within your code editor's file explorer. You should now see the "project-management-app" folder in the chosen directory.
